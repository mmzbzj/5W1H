{"text": "An Antarctic blizzard has halted an Australian icebreaker's attempt to reach a Russian ship trapped for a week with 74 people onboard, rescuers said on Monday. The Akademik Shokalskiy left New Zealand on November 28 on a private expedition to commemorate the 100th anniversary of an Antarctic journey led by Australian explorer Douglas Mawson. It became trapped in the ice on December 24, 100 nautical miles east of the French Antarctic station Dumont D'Urville. The 74 people aboard include scientists and tourists, many of them Australian, and 22 Russian crew. A first rescue attempt by a Chinese icebreaker, the Snow Dragon, had to be halted because the ice was so thick. Now another attempt, by the Aurora Australis, has been hampered by the weather. It has had to return to open waters about 18 nautical miles from the Akademik Shokalskiy because of poor visibility, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), which is co-ordinating the rescue, said. The Australian vessel had reached as close as about 10 nautical miles from the trapped ship before turning back. \"The weather condition is not safe for it to proceed, and it's gone back to open water,\" said AMSA spokeswoman Lisa Martin. The Snow Dragon is 6.7 nautical miles from the Akademik Shokalskiy and a helicopter on board will be used to rescue all 52 passengers and some crew if weather conditions permit, the Russian Foreign Ministry said Monday. Asked whether the passengers would have to see in the New Year on the stranded ship, Martin said: \"It certainly looks like they will be there tomorrow.\"", "label": {"what": ["An Antarctic blizzard has halted an Australian icebreaker's attempt to reach a Russian ship trapped", "A first rescue attempt by a Chinese icebreaker, the Snow Dragon, had to be halted", "another attempt, by the Aurora Australis, has been hampered", "It has had to return to open waters", "The Australian vessel had reached as close as about 10 nautical miles from the trapped ship before turning back", "it's gone back to open water"], "when": ["for a week", "on Monday", "on November 28", "on December 24"], "where": ["100 nautical miles east of the French Antarctic station Dumont D'Urville", "about 18 nautical miles from the Akademik Shokalskiy", "6.7 nautical miles from the Akademik Shokalskiy"], "why": ["left New Zealand", "on a private expedition to commemorate the 100th anniversary of an Antarctic journey led by Australian explorer Douglas Mawson", "hampered by the weather", "because the ice was so thick", "because of poor visibility", "The weather condition is not safe"], "who": ["rescuers", "Akademik Shokalskiy", "74 people aboard include scientists and tourists, many of them Australian, and 22 Russian crew", "Chinese icebreaker, the Snow Dragon", "Aurora Australis", "Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA)", "AMSA spokeswoman Lisa Martin", "Russian Foreign Ministry"], "damages": ["It became trapped in the ice", "the passengers would have to see in the New Year on the stranded ship"], "countermeasures": ["a helicopter on board will be used to rescue all 52 passengers and some crew if weather conditions permit"]}}
{"text": "Snow showers, strong winds and poor visibility are hampering attempts to rescue dozens of researchers, holidaymakers and crew on a ship trapped in Antarctic ice for almost a week. Australia's maritime authority said the Aurora Australis, a vessel designed to break through thick blocks of ice, had come close to the MV Akademik Shokalskiy, a Russian ship that remains stranded after two earlier rescue attempts by other icebreakers failed. The latest attempt to reach the passengers and crew was aborted after harsh weather forced the Australian rescue vessel back into open waters having come within 10 nautical miles of the distressed ship, the authority said late Monday. The icebreaker vessel is currently some 18 nautical miles away from its target. \"These weather conditions have resulted in poor visibility and made it difficult and unsafe for the Aurora Australis to continue today's attempt to assist,\" the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said in a statement. Further rescue efforts may be made, it said. The Russian ship, carrying 74 people and chartered by a team of scientists, first sent out a distress call on Christmas Day after getting stuck in ice about 1,500 nautical miles south of Hobart, the capital of Australia's Tasmania state. French and Chinese icebreakers have already failed to reach the passengers, who are believed to have several weeks of essential supplies left. The Russian ship is trapped in the Australian search-and-rescue zone of Antarctica, putting the Australian maritime body in charge of the rescue operation. The Chinese rescue vessel, Snow Dragon, earlier came within 7 miles of the stranded ship, but turned back after it became clear the ice was too thick to penetrate. The French attempt couldn't get closer than that. It is likely that a helicopter on the Chinese ship would be used to winch passengers out if the Australian ship failed to get through the ice, a spokeswoman for the maritime authority said. In its latest update, the maritime body said it was too dangerous to attempt a helicopter rescue at this time. The research team on board, led by Professor Chris Turney from the University of New South Wales, set out Dec. 8 on a mission to update scientific records on Antarctica made around a century ago by Douglas Mawson, an Australian explorer. Pack ice, solid sheets of ice up to several meters thick, is a major hazard for vessels navigating the harsh Antarctic climate, where temperatures can fall to below minus 100 degrees Fahrenheit. In 1985, the Nella Dan, an Australian research vessel, was trapped for 48 days in the Antarctic. A year later, the Southern Quest, carrying a British expedition, was crushed by ice and sank. More recently, in 2010 icebreakers had to be used to free nearly 1,000 people whose ferry was among dozens of vessels trapped by ice in the Baltic Sea off the coast of Sweden.", "label": {"what": ["Snow showers, strong winds and poor visibility are hampering attempts to rescue dozens of researchers, holidaymakers and crew on a ship trapped", "The Russian ship is trapped in the Australian search-and-rescue zone of Antarctica, putting the Australian maritime body in charge of the rescue operation."], "when": ["for almost a week", "Christmas Day", "several weeks", "Dec. 8", "around a century ago", "In 1985", "48 days", "in 2010"], "where": ["Antarctic ice", "within 10 nautical miles of the distressed ship", "1,500 nautical miles south of Hobart, the capital of Australia's Tasmania state", "within 7 miles", "in the Baltic Sea off the coast of Sweden."], "why": ["Snow showers, strong winds and poor visibility", "harsh weather", "These weather conditions have resulted in poor visibility and made it difficult and unsafe for the Aurora Australis to continue today's attempt to assist"], "who": ["the Aurora Australis", "the MV Akademik Shokalskiy", "the Australian Maritime Safety Authority", "a spokeswoman for the maritime authority", "the maritime body", "The research team on board", "Chris Turney", "Douglas Mawson, an Australian explorer"], "damages": ["Snow showers, strong winds and poor visibility are hampering attempts to rescue dozens of researchers, holidaymakers and crew on a ship trapped in Antarctic ice for almost a week.", "a Russian ship that remains stranded after two earlier rescue attempts by other icebreakers failed.", "The latest attempt to reach the passengers and crew was aborted after harsh weather forced the Australian rescue vessel back into open waters having come within 10 nautical miles of the distressed ship"], "countermeasures": ["Further rescue efforts may be made, it said", "earlier came within 7 miles of the stranded ship", "It is likely that a helicopter on the Chinese ship would be used to winch passengers out if the Australian ship failed to get through the ice"]}}
{"text": "Passengers aboard the MV Akademik Shokalskiy, the scientific research vessel that has been stuck in sea ice off the coast of Antarctica since Christmas Day, will be evacuated from the ship by helicopter as soon as the weather has cleared. Icebreakers were trying to free the ship but the dense ice floes have proved too difficult to get through for both Chinese and Australian vessels that were sent to help. At about 2pm local time on Tuesday, Greg Mortimer, co-leader of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition (AAE), gave notice of an evacuation to everyone on board the Shokalskiy. Expedition leaders then asked for volunteers among the AAE members to help prepare a landing area for the helicopter from the Chinese icebreaker Xue Long on a suitable ice floe next to the Russian-operated ship. The Chinese vessel will wait for better weather and visibility before launching the evacuation. On Tuesday morning conditions were not yet suitable, with rain, heavy winds and clouds. We're not going to be flying today, possibly not even tomorrow,   said Chris Turney, a climate scientist at the University of New South Wales and a leader of the AAE. The Australian icebreaker, the Aurora Australis, arrived at the edge of the sea ice surrounding the Shokalskiy  C about 20 nautical miles away  C in the early hours of 30 December, local time. It made several attempts to cut through the ice over the next day but was thwarted each time. On Tuesday morning its captain confirmed that the vessel would move to join the Xue Long, which itself unsuccessfully tried to break through the ice on Friday last week, to co-ordinate the air evacuation. AAE members will be picked up on the ice next to the Shokalskiy and dropped off on a similar landing pad next to the Aurora Australis. The Chinese helicopter that will be used is too heavy to land on the Australian vessel's deck. The Aurora Australis will then sail to the nearest Australian Antarctic base, Casey, before heading back to Hobart in Australia in late January. Turney said the expedition team was disappointed that the Shokalskiy had been unable to break free from the ice with help from the icebreakers and get home under its own steam. We've been so unfortunate  C there was a massive breakout of very thick, old ice from the other side of the Mertz glacier, and it was swept to sea,   he said.   There's just no way through it. Many of the icebreakers just can't get through. The Russian crew of the Shokalskiy will be given extra provisions and will remain on board after the AAE members have been evacuated. They will remain in position until the Shokalskiy can break out of the ice  C either on its own, if the winds change and blow the ice apart, or when stronger icebreaking vessels can come to help. The American icebreaker, the Polar Star, is about 10 days away and an even bigger Russian icebreaker, the Federov, is 28 days away. Either could be called upon to help the Shokalskiy if required. Turney also responded to speculation from climate sceptics who have taken to social media sites in recent days to attack the scientific consensus on climate change, pointing out the apparent incongruity of there being so much sea ice around the Shokalskiy in the middle of the Antarctic summer. There's a misconception here  C we are not trapped in new ice that's been created because its cold,   said Turney.   This is very old, thick ice that's been re-mobilised. It was attached to another part of the continent and has broken out and, with the south-easterly winds we've had, has pushed it up against the coast    and pinned us in. The event is likely to be a result of long-term climate change that is happening in this part of the world. When the 120km-long iceberg, B09B, came through the area a few years ago it knocked the tongue off the nearby Mertz glacier, which itself is 120km long. The iceberg grounded on the sea bed in Commonwealth Bay causing the sea around it to lock up with ice attached to the continent. There's no Mertz glacier tongue to hold back the sea ice that broke out in the past weeks,   said Turney.   Because there's ice in Commonwealth Bay, where we're near, that old ice couldn't go anywhere apart from here. It's unfortunate circumstances. When it got stuck last week the Shokalskiy was about two weeks into its month-long journey from Bluff in New Zealand to Commonwealth Bay in East Antarctica, following in the footsteps of the great Antarctic explorer and scientist Douglas Mawson. He led the original AAE of 1911 and the modern incarnation intended to repeat his wildlife, ocean and weather observations in order to build a picture of how this part of the world had changed in the past 100 years. The Shokalskiy has about 50 passengers, including scientists and paying members of the public, and 20 crew on board.

{"text": "The latest attempt to rescue passengers on board a research ship that has been trapped in Antarctic ice for more than a week was delayed again Thursday after sea ice prevented a barge from reaching one of the rescue vessels. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority's Rescue Coordination Centre, which is handling the operation, said earlier on Thursday that weather conditions had improved and rescue flights were expected to commence. A helicopter was expected to airlift passengers to a Chinese icebreaker, the Snow Dragon, and a barge would then ferry them to a nearby Australian vessel. But before the rescue operation could begin, sea ice had blocked the path of the barge that needed to make it from the Australian vessel, the Aurora Australis, to the Snow Dragon. Because the Aurora isn't built to handle a helicopter landing, it appeared unlikely that the passengers would be rescued Thursday, the maritime authority said. \"This rescue is a complex operation involving a number of steps. Operations in Antarctica are all weather and ice dependent and conditions can change rapidly,\" the agency said in a statement. The rescue operation for the 74 scientists, tourists and crew on the Russian ship MV Akademik Shokalskiy has been plagued by one delay after another since the vessel became stuck on Christmas Eve. Three icebreakers were initially dispatched to try and crack their way through the thick ice surrounding the ship, but all failed. The Aurora came within 12 miles of the ship Monday, but fierce winds and snow forced it to retreat to open water. Officials had been planning on Thursday to use a helicopter on board the Snow Dragon -- which is waiting at the edge of the ice pack with the Aurora -- to rescue 52 scientists and tourists, a dozen at a time, over five hours. All 22 crew members are expected to stay with their icebound vessel, which is not in danger. The passengers were then supposed to be flown 7 miles to the Chinese ship, from where they would be transported 2 miles by barge to the Australian icebreaker. They were then expected to travel to the Australian island state of Tasmania, arriving by mid-January. Earlier Thursday, it appeared likely the rescue would go ahead, with expedition leader Chris Turney posting a video on his Twitter account, blue sky visible behind him. \"A stunning day,\" he said on the video. \"Hopefully we'll hear about the evacuation soon.\" The Akademik Shokalskiy, which left New Zealand on Nov. 28, got stuck Christmas Eve after a blizzard pushed the sea ice around the ship, freezing it in place about 1,700 miles south of Hobart, Tasmania. The ship isn't in danger of sinking and has weeks' worth of supplies on board, but it cannot move.

{"text": "In a dramatic operation displaying unusual international harmony in one of the world  s most remote and inhospitable places, a red-and-white Chinese helicopter on Thursday rescued 52 passengers trapped for more than a week aboard an icebound Russian research ship in Antarctica, ferrying them a dozen at a time to an Australian icebreaker. The twin-rotor helicopter, based on a Chinese icebreaker, the Xue Long, or Snow Dragon, flew several sorties across miles of packed ice to pluck scientists, tourists and journalists from a landing zone next to the marooned vessel, the Akademik Shokalskiy. The blue-hulled Russian ship was surrounded by such dense and extensive pack ice that it could not move, and vessels designed to break through ice could not get near. Images from the people being rescued showed them smiling as they walked single file across the ice to a landing area that had been cleared by passengers and crew members to enable the helicopter to touch down. Other images on the Internet showed crew members hauling sleds with luggage. As the rescue got underway with the arrival of the Chinese helicopter, Chris Turney, a leader of the research expedition and a professor of climate change at the University of New South Wales in Australia, said in a message on Twitter that the Chinese helicopter had arrived.   It  s 100% we  re off!   he wrote.   A huge thanks to all. The rescue was closely followed around the world by scientists and others, with journalists on board sending progress reports as the passengers were lifted to safety aboard the Australian icebreaker, the Aurora Australis. Before the operation began, rescuers said they were worried that the weather would turn bad and prevent the helicopter from flying. The helicopter captain, Jia Shuliang, told the Chinese state news agency Xinhua that the rescue would take five or six flights and last three or four hours if conditions were good. We must be patient and wait until the adverse weather improves, as poor visibility could lead to tragedy under the current conditions of limited navigation,   he said before the first flight. But, several hours later, Dr. Turney sent another message on Twitter saying,   We  ve made it to the Aurora Australis safe and sound.   The Australian Maritime Safety Agency, which coordinated the rescue, said the crew of the Aurora Australis had confirmed that the 52 passengers were on board. The ship is to take the rescued passengers to the Australian island state of Tasmania, arriving there in mid-January. The 22 crew members of the Russian research ship planned to stay on board until the ice releases its grip. The ship is well stocked for a long voyage, passengers said. The 233-foot Russian research ship has been lodged in the ice since Dec. 24, when powerful winds encircled it with pack ice near Cape de la Motte, about 1,700 miles south of Hobart, Tasmania. The ship had set sail from Bluff, New Zealand, on Dec. 8, embarking on a planned monthlong voyage known as the Australasian Antarctic Expedition to study changes to the environment of East Antarctica since an Australian geologist, Douglas Mawson, surveyed the region a century ago. Efforts to rescue the passengers began when the Aurora Australis was diverted from a resupply operation at an Australian Antarctic base. But the ship was unable to break through and risked becoming stuck itself, according to Australian maritime authorities. The Xue Long failed in a similar attempt on Saturday but remained in the area.

{"text": "After 10 days stranded far from home, all 52 passengers from a ship stuck in Antarctic ice have now been transferred by helicopter to an Australian icebreaker. \"It's 100% we're off! A huge thanks to all,\" tweeted Chris Turney, an Australian professor among the group of scientists, journalists and tourists marooned on the ship. A helicopter from a nearby Chinese icebreaker ferried passengers Thursday to the Australian icebreaker, the Aurora Australis. The rescue is the latest chapter in a saga that began Christmas Eve after the Russian-flagged MV Akademik Shokalskiy got stuck in unusually thick ice. Officials abandoned a succession of other rescue attempts in recent days because of the treacherous conditions in the region. Earlier Thursday, Australian authorities had said a plan involving the helicopter and a barge was put on hold because of shifting ice conditions. But the new approach, which skipped the use of the barge, got under way later in the day. Turney posted videos showing the helicopter arriving on a makeshift helipad on the ice near the trapped ship and taking off into the crisp blue sky. Robert Darvill, chief mate on the Aurora Australis, told CNN that the 52 new passengers on board were very happy to be there and kept thanking the icebreaker's crew for their efforts. \"They are on their second dinner of the night right now,\" he said. Long journey ahead It will still be weeks before the research team makes it to the Australian port of Hobart, said John Young of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. \"Mid-January is our best guess,\" Young told reporters on a conference call. The Aurora Australis is still expected to complete a resupply mission to Casey Station, an Australian base in Antarctica, before making its way to Hobart. Darvill said that now all the passengers are on the Aurora Australis, the vessel will try to move out of the heavy pack ice and into more open water. But, he said, they will not set off toward Casey Station until the Rescue Coordination Center of Australia gives them the green light. Darvill also thanked the captain of the Chinese icebreaker whose help made the rescue possible. \"Thank you very much for your cooperation. Your crew has done the lion's share of the work and made Australia and much of the world proud,\" he said. Meanwhile, the master of the Akademik Shokalskiy has decided to keep the 22 Russian crew members on board the stranded ship until the pack ice eventually breaks up and allows it to move again, Young said. The vessel has enough supplies to keep the crew going for \"a very long time,\" he said. The helicopter rescue followed a failed attempt by the Chinese icebreaker, the Xue Long, which made it 6 nautical miles from the trapped vessel before being stopped by especially thick ice. That was followed by an effort by the Australian icebreaker, which was forced Monday to suspend efforts to reach the expedition because of bad weather. The Aurora Australis got within 10 nautical miles of the ship before it turned back. Over the weekend, the maritime agency called off an effort by the French icebreaker Astrolabe. Viral sensations The exploits of the research crew have gone viral, thanks in large part to Twitter and YouTube posts by those aboard the stranded vessel. Turney, the leader of a research expedition on the Akademik Shokalskiy, has tweeted photos of the stranded ship, the crew and penguins, which have stopped by to check out their new neighbors. The group even managed to ring in 2014 with good cheer. \"We're the A, A, E who have traveled far, having fun doing science in Antarctica!\" a dozen or so of them sang in a video posted on YouTube. \"Lots of snow and lots of ice, lots of penguins, which are very, very nice! \"Really good food and company, but a bloody great shame we are still stuck here! Ice core, cha cha cha! Ice core, cha cha cha!\" The expedition Turney's expedition to gauge the effects of climate change on the region began on November 27.

{"text": "Rescuers in Antarctica have safely transferred all 52 passengers stranded on the ice-bound research vessel Akademik Shokalskiy. The Australian rescue operators said the scientists and tourists were now all aboard the ship Aurora Australis. They were flown there in groups by a helicopter from a Chinese ice-breaker. The Shokalskiy has been trapped since 24 December. Its 22 crew are expected to remain on board to wait until the vessel becomes free. The Shokalskiy was trapped by thick sheets of ice driven by strong winds, about 1,500 nautical miles south of Hobart - the capital of the Australian state of Tasmania. The vessel was being used by the Australasian Antarctic Expedition to follow the route explorer Douglas Mawson travelled a century ago. 'White-knuckle ride' \"We've made it to the Aurora australis safe  and  sound. A huge thanks to the Chinese  and  @AusAntarctic for all their hard work!,\" expedition leader Chris Turney tweeted. The helicopter belongs to the Chinese icebreaker, Xue Long, and each flight took about 45 minutes, round-trip. The BBC's Andrew Luck-Baker, who was on board the Akademik Shokalskiy, says the 15-minute one-way flight was a \"white-knuckle ride\". The passengers were taken to an ice floe next to the Aurora Australis and then ferried on to the ice-breaker by a small boat. Our correspondent says the Russian crew staying behind could be on the Akademik Shokalskiy for weeks before the pack ice clears. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority's (Amsa) Rescue Co-ordination Centre, which was overseeing the operation, had earlier said it was unlikely the rescue would go ahead on Thursday as hoped because of the sea-ice conditions. But it later reported: \"Aurora Australis has advised Amsa that the 52 passengers from the Akademik Shokalskiy are now on board.\" The passengers are not expected back in Tasmania until mid-January. Several attempts to break through to the ship by sea - by the Xue Long, Aurora Australis and French-flagged L'Astrolabe - failed because of the thickness of the ice. Andrew Luck-Baker says the Aurora Australis, although big, was simply not up to the task and there is speculation two larger vessels may be coming to the area in the weeks to come. Despite being trapped, the scientists continued their experiments, measuring temperature and salinity through cracks in the surrounding ice.

They were flown by helicopter from the MV Akademik Shokalskiy to an ice floe next to Australian icebreaker the Aurora Australis, and then taken by a small boat to the vessel. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority's Rescue Coordination Centre, which is overseeing the rescue, confirmed that 52 passengers had made it on to the Aurora. Expedition leader Professor Chris Turney tweeted: \"We've made it to the Aurora australis safe  and  sound. A huge thanks to the Chinese  and  @AusAntarctic for all their hard work!\" A helicopter carried the passengers a dozen at a time in an operation that lasted for around five hours. The Aurora will take them to Tasmania, arriving around mid-January. A helicopter had been expected to airlift passengers to a Chinese icebreaker, the Snow Dragon, on New Year's Day with a barge then ferrying them to the Aurora. However, before the operation could begin, sea ice had blocked the path of the barge that needed to make it to the Snow Dragon. And because the Aurora is not built to handle a helicopter landing, the rescue was postponed. The rescue operation for the scientists, tourists and crew on the Russian ship has been plagued by a number of problems. Three icebreakers were initially dispatched to try to crack their way through the thick ice surrounding the ship, but all failed. The Aurora came within 12 miles (20km) of the ship on Monday, but fierce winds and snow forced it to retreat to open water. The Akademik Shokalskiy is not in danger of sinking, and there are supplies for those on board, but the vessel cannot move. The 22 Russian crew members are expected to stay on board for as long as it takes to free the ship from the pack ice surrounding it.

{"text": "Baton-wielding riot police on Monday cleared Taiwan's Cabinet offices of scores of angry protesters opposed to a trade pact with China, escalating tensions over the island's rapidly developing ties with the communist mainland. Authorities said they arrested 58 protesters and that 137 were injured, including 24 that were hospitalized. The crackdown came five days after mainly student demonstrators occupied the nearby legislature to protest the ruling party's decision to renege on a promised line-by-line review of the trade agreement. Political protests in Taiwan are common, but violent confrontations relatively rare, reflecting the high level of civil discourse resulting from the transition from one-party dictatorship to robust democracy in the mid-1990s. The protests have been mostly peaceful, attracting tens of thousands of supporters to the government center. China's government has not commented on the protests, although an editorial Monday in the official newspaper Global Times was harshly critical. \"The Taiwanese students lack the courage and determination to commit to regional economic integration, fear losing out and change and only wish to defend the status quo,\" the editorial read, contrasting Taiwan's hesitation with South Korea's embrace of the Chinese economy. Early Sunday, Ma rejected protester demands to shelve the trade pact, which would open dozens of service sector industries to Chinese investment. It was signed in June by representatives from Taipei and Beijing, but still awaits ratification by Taiwan's legislature. Ma said that rejecting the pact now would undermine Taiwan's credibility and harm its economy, which has become increasingly tied to Chinese markets. Student leaders insist tying Taiwan too closely to China will harm Taiwan's hard-won democratic freedoms and pave the way for China's eventual takeover of the island.

{"text": "(CNN) -- A suicide car bomber killed four people and injured 27 others in a neighborhood in southern Beirut on Tuesday, Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported. Taiwanese police have clashed with hundreds of students who occupied government headquarters to protest at a trade deal with China. Police used water cannon and dragged out students one by one, clearing the building by dawn on Monday. Close to 60 people were arrested and more than 100 hurt, reports said. The protesters say the agreement with China would hurt Taiwan's economy and leave it vulnerable to pressure from Beijing. Another group of students and activists have occupied Taiwan's parliament since early last week. The BBC's Cindy Sui in Taipei says the students wants more scrutiny over all future dealings with China, including any trade agreements. They also want the current deal - which would allow the two sides to invest more freely in each other's services markets - to be scrapped. The governing Kuomintang party says it is determined to ratify the deal with Beijing, which it says will boost the economy and create jobs. China formally regards Taiwan as a part of its territory, despite the island governing itself for six decades. Trading partners The protests began early last week after ruling party MPs said a joint committee had completed its review of the pact, which was signed in June 2013 but has not yet been ratified by MPs. Students broke into the legislature late on Tuesday and have since defied police efforts to evict them, using barricades made of furniture. On Friday thousands of people rallied to support the students, and the the opposition Democratic Progressive Party has also backed them. On Sunday, President Ma Ying-jeou said that the occupation of parliament broke the law, adding: \"I must say that [the pact] is completely for the sake of Taiwan's economic future.\" Late on Sunday, some protesters pushed past riot police to storm the government headquarters, pulling down barbed wire and using ladders to access second-floor offices. Violent clashes erupted as police moved to restore order. China is Taiwan's biggest trading partner and in recent years ties between the two have improved. The two sides split at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. Earlier this year, however, they held their first direct government-to-government talks. In the past, all talks have gone via quasi-official organisations.

{"text": "(CNN) -- Riot police evicted scores of protesters from Taiwan's executive building early Monday morning as rallies over a controversial trade deal between Taiwan and mainland China entered their seventh day. Hundreds of protesters stormed the Executive Yuan in Taipei on Sunday evening, shortly after Taiwan's president Ma Ying-jeou dismissed protesters' demands to scrap a service trade agreement with China. Opponents of the deal say it could harm Taiwan's economy, democratic system and national security. Police used high-pressure water cannons to disperse the demonstrators, who were mostly university students. Meanwhile, other protesters continue their sit-in at the nearby legislature building, where they have been since March 18. \"We are tired, very tired. But we will continue on for democracy,\" a spokesperson for the movement, Lin Fei-fan told CNN on Monday. \"We have been protesting for seven days now. After last night's violence we are shaken,\" he said. Lin estimated there were up to 200 protesters inside the Legislative Yuan's main assembly hall Monday, with more outside the building. \"Last night many students were injured and bloodied, some got concussions and bone fractures,\" he said. According to Taiwan's Central News Agency, at least 137 people, including protesters, police and journalists, have been hospitalized since the rallies began last week. Most had minor injuries. Taiwan's premier Jiang Yi-huah said some 61 people were arrested for breaking into the executive building, including 35 who were still being questioned as of Monday morning, CNA reported. Dubbed the \"Sunflower Movement\" by Taiwanese media, the protesters are calling on the government to scrap a controversial trade deal which was signed in Shanghai last year. They say the agreement will threaten small business and allow China to exert greater influence in the island through investments in \"sensitive and core industries,\" including those associated with press freedom such as publishing and advertising. On Sunday, Taiwan's President Ma Ying-jeou defended the pact with China -- the island's biggest trade partner -- and said that it would benefit the economy and create jobs for young people. \"Regional economic integration is an unstoppable global trend. If we do not face this and join in the process, it will only be a matter of time before we are eliminated from the competition. For the sake of the nation's development, we truly have no choice,\" Ma said. Some Taiwanese believe parts of the agreement are beneficial to Taiwan's future, but many are incensed by what they believe were procedural errors in passing the pact. \"We feel that the content of the agreement was developed in 'black box' negotiations,\" protest leader Lin said. \"The opinions of workers were not consulted and it was passed without deliberation. This is against our democratic principles.\" Taiwan and China signed the trade pact in June last year, but a review of the deal has been delayed in the legislature. On March 17, the governing party Kuomintang pushed the pact forward without bipartisan deliberation, a move that the opposition said broke an agreement that all legislators would consider the deal line by line. The Kuomintang has since agreed to review the pact one clause at a time during a second reading of the deal. President Ma is taking a hard stance against the students. His government did not respond to a March 21 ultimatum by protesters to issue an apology for the deal. On Sunday, Ma appeared in public to address the protests for the first time: \"Is this the kind of democracy that we want? The foundation of democracy is rule of law -- adhering to the rule of law is fundamental to our statehood,\" Ma said. The protesters have called for a students' strike across Taiwan commencing Monday. Student unions from four major universities said they will participate. The director of the National Tsing-Hua University's Institute of Sociology said in a statement that all classes at the institute will be called off for one week. If the government gives the student protesters a \"satisfactory response,\" classes will resume immediately, he said. According to Lin, the protest leader, at least 1,000 students were taking part in the strike as of Monday afternoon. He said that the Taiwanese public has welcomed their campaign. \"I feel that most Taiwanese are supportive of us. They have been very warm towards us. We see parents bringing their kids to come and visit us,\" Lin said. Although Taiwan governs itself as the Republic of China, with Beijing considering it a breakaway province, relations between the former rivals have improved since Ma took office in 2008. Last month, Taiwan and mainland China held their highest-level talks in more than six decades. The meeting marked the first government-to-government contact since their split in 1949 following the Chinese Civil War.

{"text": "(Reuters) - Hundreds of demonstrators occupied part of Taiwan's government headquarters on Sunday night in protest against a controversial trade pact with mainland China. President Ma Ying-jeou says the pact with Taiwan's main export market is essential for the island's prosperity. However, the main opposition party says it could hurt small service companies, and many others are reluctant to let China expand its influence over a fiercely independent and democratic territory that China still sees as a renegade province. Television footage showed protesters and police scuffling after several people forced their way into the building. The reports said the demonstrators had barricaded doors and windows with tables and chairs and seized the computer of the head of the presidential cabinet, and that at least 13 people had been injured. Opponents of the pact forced their way into the island's parliament last Tuesday, and have taken to the surrounding streets every day since then. Parliamentary approval of the agreement on April 8 would open 80 of China's service sectors to Taiwan and 64 Taiwanese sectors to China. \"This is completely for the sake of Taiwan's economic future,\" said Ma, who since 2008 has signed a series of landmark trade and economic agreements with China. Ma and his ruling Kuomintang Party say Taiwan needs the pact not only to maintain the competitiveness of its exports but also as an entry ticket to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a broad trade deal among 12 countries, spearheaded by the United States. Ma said he understood the passion of the mostly young protesters, as Taiwan \"can only have a future if young people care about the country and are brave enough to participate\". But he said their occupation was illegal and hampering the work of government. \"Are we not proud of Taiwan's democracy and rule of law?\" Ma said. \"If there is no rule of law, democracy cannot be protected.\" Taiwan made a peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy in the late 1980s, and now boasts one of Asia's most freewheeling democracies. Fights in parliament are common and protests are almost a daily occurrence. Taiwan and China have been ruled separately since the Communists took power on the mainland in 1949, though relations have warmed considerably since the China-friendly Ma won the presidency in 2008 and secured re-election in 2012.", "label": {"what": ["Hundreds of demonstrators occupied part of Taiwan's government headquarters", "protesters and police scuffling after several people forced their way into the building", "Opponents of the pact forced their way into the island's parliament", "Ma, who since 2008 has signed a series of landmark trade and economic agreements with China", "Taiwan made a peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy in the late 1980s"], "when": ["on Sunday night", "last Tuesday", "on April 8"], "where": ["Taiwan's government headquarters", "parliament", "the surrounding streets"], "why": ["protest against a controversial trade pact with mainland China", "for the sake of Taiwan's economic future"], "who": ["Reuters", "President Ma Ying jeou", "the main opposition party", "ruling Kuomintang Party", "Taiwan", "the United States", "young people"], "how": ["the demonstrators had barricaded doors and windows with tables and chairs and seized the computer of the head of the presidential cabinet"], "damages": ["at least 13 people had been injured"], "countermeasures": ["President Ma Ying-jeou says the pact with Taiwan's main export market is essential for the island's prosperity"], "perpetrators": ["Hundreds of demonstrators"]}}
{"text": "Taiwan riot police have used water cannons to dislodge hundreds of demonstrators who stormed government headquarters, dramatically escalating an ongoing protest against a trade pact with China. After nearly a week-long occupation of Taiwan's parliament, the protesters late on Sunday also infiltrated the Executive Yuan where the cabinet is located, pulling down barbed-wire barricades and using ladders to break into offices on the second floor. The assault came after President Ma Ying-jeou refused to back down on the trade pact, which he argues is vital for Taiwan's economic future, rejecting opposition claims he is effectively handing the island over to Chinese control after six decades of political separation. About 1000 officers were deployed overnight to forcibly remove the protesters from the Executive Yuan. Premier Jiang Yi-huah, whose office is located in the building, said at least 110 people were injured, including 52 police officers, while police arrested 61 people. \"Suddenly water was spraying at us and it was very powerful. My glasses flew off and I was very dizzy,\" protester Frank Hsieh, a former premier from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), told reporters.

Police used riot shields to push the crowds back while some of the demonstrators tried to grab their batons and pelted them with plastic bottles.

We will not tolerate actions designed to paralyse the government,\" the presidential office said in a statement. But the DPP, which historically has favoured formal independence for Taiwan, called on Ma to respond to the protesters' demands and scrap the pact. \"Forcible dispersals will only cause more students and police to get hurt and are likely to trigger more outrage and protests,\" the party said in a statement. Ma has overseen a marked thaw in relations with Beijing since he came to power in 2008 pledging to strengthen trade and tourism links. \"I must say that (the pact) is completely for the sake of Taiwan's economic future,\" Ma told a news conference on Sunday.

{"text": "Baton-wielding riot police cleared Taiwan's cabinet offices of scores of angry protesters opposed to a trade pact with China, escalating tensions over the island's rapidly developing ties with the communist mainland. Authorities said they arrested 58 protesters and that 137 were injured, including 24 hospitalised. The crackdown came five days after mainly student demonstrators occupied the nearby legislature to protest the ruling party's decision to renege on a promised line-by-line review of the trade agreement. Political protests in Taiwan are common but violent confrontations relatively rare, reflecting the high level of civil discourse resulting from the transition from one-party dictatorship to robust democracy in the mid-1990s. The protests have been mostly peaceful, attracting tens of thousands of supporters to the government centre. China's government has not commented on the protests, although an editorial in the official newspaper Global Times criticised the students' action. \"The Taiwanese students lack the courage and determination to commit to regional economic integration, fear losing out and change and only wish to defend the status quo,\" the editorial read, contrasting Taiwan's hesitation with South Korea's embrace of the Chinese economy. On Sunday, the Taiwanese president, Ma Ying-jeou, rejected protesters' demands to shelve the trade pact, which would open dozens of service sector industries to Chinese investment. It was signed in June by representatives from Taipei and Beijing but awaits ratification by Taiwan's legislature. Ma said rejecting the pact would undermine Taiwan's credibility and harm its economy, which has become increasingly tied to Chinese markets. Student leaders insist tying Taiwan too closely to China would harm Taiwan's hard-won democratic freedoms and pave the way for China's eventual takeover of the island.

{"text": "TAIPEI, Taiwan   Taiwan s prime minister said on Monday that the government had been justified in using force to remove demonstrators from the cabinet building earlier in the day, as students continued to occupy the nearby legislature in a protest against a trade bill with China. What happened yesterday wasn t police suppressing a street march,  Prime Minister Jiang Yi-huah said.  It was protesters breaking into the Executive Yuan, trying to occupy this building and paralyze our administrative workings,  he added, referring to the cabinet building. At least 174 people, including 119 police officers, were wounded as the police wielded wooden clubs and later used water trucks to block the growing protest. In a statement posted online, the protesters who have occupied the legislature, or Legislative Yuan, since last week said that they  strongly condemn the violence against the unarmed, weaponless students. Mr. Jiang said that 61 people were arrested when the police cleared the building Monday morning, and that 35 of them faced possible prosecution. The government faces broadening concerns, as some student groups have now called for a work and school strike across this self-governed island of 23 million to allow more to attend the demonstrations in Taipei, the capital. In an hourlong news conference on Monday at the Executive Yuan, just hours after it had been cleared of demonstrators, Mr. Jiang urged students not to push for a strike. The nature of this matter is that all levels of society have different views as to the signing of the service trade agreement, but that is no reason to use as a pretext for a national work and school strike,  he said. The China trade bill, which would allow cross-strait investment on dozens of service trades ranging from banking to funeral parlors, has touched deep roots of concern, including Taiwan s own history of authoritarian rule and its uneasy relationship with China, an emerging giant that considers the island part of its own territory that must eventually be reunited. While many of the student demonstrators opposed the deal outright, others said they supported lowering trade barriers on some industries. Their most fundamental objection, they said, was to the way the deal was moved through Taiwan s legislature. Members of Kuomintang, the governing party, forced the motion through to the legislative floor without a promised item-by-item review. The opposition Democratic Progressive Party cried foul. Many demonstrators have described the moves by the Kuomintang as  authoritarian,  a pointed reference to the party s all-powerful role in Taiwan before democratization in the 1980s and  90s. Spread propaganda and ignore the opinion of the public, this is neither democracy nor rule of law,  a student leader, Lin Fei-fan, chanted from the rostrum of the occupied legislature on Sunday. The Kuomintang holds a comfortable margin in the legislature, meaning it can eventually ratify the trade pact, which was signed by semiofficial organizations representing Taiwan and China last June. What the government has been doing is trying to play this as low-profile as possible,  said Lin Jih-wen, a political science research fellow at Academia Sinica, a state-funded research institution in Taipei. It doesn t want society to discuss this and wanted to just pass this in a short period of time. That exposed not only the outrage of the students but also the general public. President Ma Ying-jeou, who has made closer relations with China a crucial goal, said the accord was necessary for Taiwan to maintain its economic competitiveness. He said that without this pact, which was a follow-up agreement to the 2010 Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement between the two sides, Taiwan will be unable to pursue agreements with other countries and trade organizations, like the United States-led Trans-Pacific Partnership. Trade between China and Taiwan has rapidly expanded during Mr. Ma s six years in office, nearly doubling to reach $197 billion last year. But some of the debate over the trade pact revolves around concerns that China may use economics to further its claims to Taiwan. Sovereignty lurks behind this at all times,  said Titus C. Chen, an associate research fellow at the Institute of International Relations at National Chengchi University in Taipei.  It s a unique Taiwan concern. I think this service agreement is just one more building block for President Ma to inch toward a peace agreement or fundamental relations with China. The students occupying the legislature said they will continue their protest until the trade bill is returned to committee for an itemized review, and they have asked for passage of a law that will allow for closer scrutiny of agreements with China. Unlike the protest in the Executive Yuan, the government has expressed a willingness to tolerate the occupation of the legislature for the time being.

{"text": "TAIPEIXTaiwan's police evicted dozens of protesters from the cabinet building early Monday morning, as tensions continued to spiral between the government and students occupying two major government buildings over a controversial trade pact with China. Shortly after midnight, police made several attempts to remove protesters who stormed the Executive YuanXthe governing cabinet's officeXon Sunday evening, hours after President Ma Ying-jeou rejected protesters' demands to retract a services trade agreement signed with China in Shanghai last year. Antiriot police, wearing helmets and clutching shields, rammed through a human wall of protesters linked arm-in-arm to block the entrance of the Executive Yuan. In the midst of the brawl, some protesters held their hands up to show they meant no harm and were yanked away by police. Police arrested 58 people for trespassing, and a dozen were injured in the scuffle, the government-run Central News Agency reported. Police officials weren't immediately available for comment. The Executive Yuan is a block away from the legislative building, which has been seized by thousands of students and protesters since Tuesday. Police haven't made any attempt to remove protesters there. During a news conference in Taipei early Sunday, Mr. MaXalso the head of the ruling Chinese Nationalist Party, or the KuomintangXsaid retracting the trade agreement would undermine Taiwan's credibility as a trade partner, and he dismissed concerns the deal would hurt small businesses. \"The pact must be passed for the sake of Taiwan's economic future,\" Mr. Ma said. He noted that Taiwan now has only seven free-trade partners, while its main export competitor, South Korea, already enjoys tariff-free treatment in more than 40 countries. \"Signing free-trade agreements is an inevitable trend on which Taiwan can't afford to miss out,\" he said. In a statement issued late Sunday, Mr. Ma condemned the violence and asked police to exercise all legal means to expel the protesters. He had said in his previous statements the government wouldn't evict protesters by force. One of the student leaders, Lin Fei-fan, urged Mr. Ma to halt all eviction orders and asked protesters to fight by peaceful means. \"Don't let our hard work in the past week go down the drain,\" Mr. Lin told protesters. He added that the crowd that stormed the Executive Yuan did so on their own accord, and that their actions don't represent the student-led movement. Earlier Sunday, one of the leaders vowed to continue occupying the legislature's assembly hall until the students' demands are met. \"The president has completely missed the point. Our demand is to retract the pact and establish a mechanism to monitor all cross-Strait deals in the future,\" said Chen Wei-ting. The protests have been among the island's most divisive since Mr. Ma came to power six years ago, promising to build closer economic ties between China and Taiwan, former antagonists in the decades-old Chinese civil war. According to Mr. Ma's government, the pact, which focuses on services, is an essential step to further liberalize cross-Strait trade and will provide select businesses with wider access to China's market. Protesters, though, have demanded that the agreement be nullified and seized the meeting chamber of the Legislative Yuan on Tuesday. They argue that the deal will hurt small businesses and job prospects for people in Taiwan, especially the young. They say that the negotiations lacked transparency and that the deal may enable China to exert more influence over Taiwan's economy and politics. Some opponents also fear that growing Chinese clout in self-ruled Taiwan may undermine the island's democratic system. Despite warming ties, Beijing hasn't retracted its vow to take back Taiwan, by force if necessary. Dubbed the \"Sunflower Movement,\" the students' seizure of the legislative chamber followed the KMT's unilateral passage of the pact during a first reading without bipartisan deliberation on March 17. Protesters interpret the KMT's move as backing away from its earlier commitment to the opposition Democratic Progressive Party to review the pact one clause at a time. Three days into the occupation, the KMT softened its stance by agreeing to review the agreement line by line during the second legislative reading of the deal. The protest, once numbering more than 10,000 people, is the biggest student-led protest in Taiwan's history. It is also the first time that the legislature has been taken over by protesters. Many professors have publicly stated their support for the students, agreeing to cancel classes for the duration of the protest. Thousands of antiriot police are on the scene, but so far there have been no major altercations. The government said it won't forcefully evict the protesters but hopes the students end the occupation to allow the legislature to resume operation immediately. At least one major cross-border acquisition will depend on the fate of the trade agreement. Industrial Commercial Bank of China Ltd.'s planned NT$20 billion (US$675 million) acquisition of a 20% stake in Taiwan's midsize Bank SinoPac, 2890.TW +0.69% announced in April, is pending ratification. Vivien Hsu, spokeswoman for Fubon Financial Holdings, 2881.TW +0.49%  Taiwan's second -biggest financial provider, said failure to pass the trade pact would impede the financial industry's entry into China \"because many investment regulations are tied to the pact.\" Chung-hua Institution for Economic Research, a government think tank, said earlier the agreement could add 12,000 jobs to Taiwan's services sector, with the biggest beneficiaries being retail and storage sectors. It could also add around 0.025-0.034 percentage point to Taiwan's gross domestic product, it said. The service sectors account for nearly 70% of Taiwan's GDP and employ more than 60% of the island's workforce, according to the Bureau of Foreign Trade.", "label": {"what": ["TAIPEIXTaiwan's police evicted dozens of protesters from the cabinet building", "some protesters held their hands up to show they meant no harm", "the legislative building, which has been seized by thousands of students and protesters", "Mr. Ma condemned the violence and asked police to exercise all legal means to expel the protesters", "Lin Fei-fan, urged Mr. Ma to halt all eviction orders and asked protesters to fight by peaceful means", "one of the leaders vowed to continue occupying the legislature's assembly hall until the students' demands are met", "Protesters, though, have demanded that the agreement be nullified and seized the meeting chamber of the Legislative Yuan", "Dubbed the 'Sunflower Movement,' the students' seizure of the legislative chamber", "the KMT softened its stance by agreeing to review the agreement line by line during the second legislative reading of the deal", "Many professors have publicly stated their support for the students, agreeing to cancel classes", "Thousands of antiriot police are on the scene, but so far there have been no major altercations"], "when": ["early Monday morning", "Shortly after midnight", "Sunday evening", "last year", "In the midst of the brawl", "immediately", "since Tuesday", "During a news conference", "early Sunday", "late Sunday", "in the past week", "Earlier Sunday", "six years ago", "in the decades-old Chinese civil war", "on Tuesday", "on March 17", "Three days into the occupation", "for the duration of the protest", "so far", "in April"], "where": ["TAIPEIX", "the Executive YuanXthe governing cabinet's officeX", "in Shanghai", "the entrance of the Executive Yuan", "the legislative building", "in Taipei", "in more than 40 countries", "the legislature's assembly hall", "the meeting chamber of the Legislative Yuan", "on the scene"], "why": ["the government and students occupying two major government buildings over a controversial trade pact with China", "President Ma Ying-jeou rejected protesters' demands to retract a services trade agreement signed with China ", "for trespassing", "for the sake of Taiwan's economic future", "the deal will hurt small businesses and job prospects for people in Taiwan, especially the young", "the negotiations lacked transparency and that the deal may enable China to exert more influence over Taiwan's economy and politics", "growing Chinese clout in self-ruled Taiwan may undermine the island's democratic system", "the KMT's unilateral passage of the pact during a first reading without bipartisan deliberation", "Protesters interpret the KMT's move as backing away from its earlier commitment to the opposition Democratic Progressive Party", "the agreement could add 12,000 jobs to Taiwan's services sector, with the biggest beneficiaries being retail and storage sectors"], "who": ["Taiwan's police", "the government and students", "President Ma Ying-jeou", "the government-run Central News Agency", "58 people", "a dozen", "Police officials", "thousands of students and protesters", "Mr. MaXalso the head of the ruling Chinese Nationalist Party, or the KuomintangX", "a trade partner", "small businesses", "The pact", "its main export competitor, South Korea", "One of the student leaders, Lin Fei-fan", "one of the leaders", "The president", "Chen Wei-ting", "China and Taiwan", "the young", "Some opponents", "Democratic Progressive Party", "Many professors", "Thousands of antiriot police", "Industrial Commercial Bank of China Ltd.", "Taiwan's second -biggest financial provider", "Vivien Hsu, spokeswoman for Fubon Financial Holdings", "KMT"], "how": ["Antiriot police, wearing helmets and clutching shields, rammed through a human wall of protesters linked arm-in-arm to block the entrance of the Executive Yuan.", "Chung-hua Institution for Economic Research, a government think tank"], "damages": ["a dozen were injured in the scuffle"], "countermeasures": ["police made several attempts to remove protesters", "were yanked away by police", "Police arrested 58 people", "Police haven't made any attempt to remove protesters there"], "perpetrators": ["dozens of protesters", "protesters who stormed the Executive YuanXthe governing cabinet's officeX", "the crowd that stormed the Executive Yuan", "Some opponents"]}}
{"text": "More than 150 people were injured and 61 students arrested after riot police armed with batons and water cannon waded in to break up a protest over a trade pact with China at Taiwan's parliament in the early hours of Monday. Seven waves of police brandishing riot shields marched towards students forcing them away from the courtyard of the Executive Yuan building, which demonstrators had broken into hours earler, after President Ma Ying-jeou failed to soothe public anger at his administration's handling of the free-trade pact with the mainland. Demonstrators chanting \"No more police brutality\" and \"Police back off\" laid down and linked arms and legs in an effort to halt the eviction from the cabinet compound, while others lashed out at police before being beaten back with batons and, as dawn broke, water cannon. Defiant students, some bleeding and bruised, pledged to continue their protest over the ruling party's decision to renege on a promised line-by-line review of the trade agreement. \"How could they treat us like a rioter? We are just plain students,\" said a soaking wet and weeping Huang Pei-feng, a sophomore of National Taiwan University, who was among those who faced the water canon. \"This won't stop us. We will continue our protest until [president] Ma Ying-jeou scraps the trade service pact,\" said Alex Chen, a student of National Chengkung University, after he was dragged to the ground during the dispersal. Premier Jiang Yi-huah, whose office is in the Executive Yuan building, said earlier that at least 110 people were injured, including 52 police officers, while 61 arrests were made. Associated Press put the number of students injured at 137. The occupation of the Cabinet offices on Sunday marked a sharp escalation in tactics by a mostly student-led protest movement that now appears to be showing signs of a split between anti-government militants and a main group seeking dialogue with President Ma Ying-jeou on the China trade pact. Chinas government has not commented on the protests, although an editorial Monday in the Global Times was harshly critical. The Taiwanese students lack the courage and determination to commit to regional economic integration, fear losing out and change and only wish to defend the status quo, the editorial read. Tensions first exploded into the open six days ago when around 200 demonstrators, mostly young students, broke through security barriers and took over parliaments main chamber, the first such occupation of the building in the islands history. President Ma Ying-jeou denounced the illegal occupation of  parliament by students opposed to the trade agreements ratification. Political protests in Taiwan are common, but violent confrontations relatively rare, reflecting the high level of civil discourse resulting from the transition from one-party dictatorship to robust democracy in the mid-1990s In his first press conference since the occupation began, Ma on Sunday called on the protesters to leave the chamber. He said the pact was vital to Taiwan's economy and he condemned the occupation as illegal. The agreement would open up as many as 80 services industries, including banking, hospitals and e-commerce companies to markets and competition. \"I perfectly understand the students' concern about national affairs,\" Ma said. \"But they should never have resorted to illegal means.\" Ma cancelled all public activities scheduled for Monday and will meet senior officials to assess the impact of the protest. A Jiang spokesman said: \"Such a violation of law is unacceptable and for this the premier has ordered that the National Police Administration increase the police force to dispel them.\" Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin also asked Taipei police to restore order. Police authorities were reported to have mobilised 3,000 officers, and riot police began to remove demonstrators after midnight. At least 20 students were detained.

{"text": "A moderate earthquake that rattled a swath of Southern California forced several dozen people in one community out of their homes after firefighters discovered foundation problems that made the buildings unsafe to enter, authorities said Saturday. Fire crews red-tagged 20 apartment units in a building in the Orange County city of Fullerton after finding a major foundation crack. Structural woes, including broken chimneys and leaning, were uncovered in half a dozen single-family houses, which were also deemed unsafe to occupy until building inspectors clear the structures. The damage displaced 83 residents. Despite the evacuations and scattered damage, Friday night's magnitude-5.1 earthquake centered about 25 miles south of downtown Los Angeles mostly frayed nerves. The quake was preceded by two smaller foreshocks. More than 100 aftershocks followed, including a magnitude-4.1 that hit Saturday afternoon, the largest in the sequence so far that was felt over a wide region. No injuries were reported. Residents were inconvenienced and some lost valuables, but \"thankfully the damage wasn't greater,\" said Chi-Chung Keung, a spokesman for the city of Fullerton. Business owners in Orange County spent the aftermath sweeping up shattered glass and restocking shelves. Utility crews worked to restore power and shut off gas leaks and water-main breaks. A rock slide in the Carbon Canyon area of nearby Brea also caused a car to overturn. The occupants had minor injuries, and the road remained closed to traffic. The Red Cross opened a shelter in neighboring La Habra but closed it once the 38 people who stayed overnight returned home. \"Everything is starting to get settled down here,\" La Habra police Sgt. Mel Ruiz said. In Fullerton, some residents will have to stay elsewhere until building inspectors can check out the red-tagged apartments and houses and give an all-clear, Fire Battalion Chief John Stokes said. Another 14 residential structures around the city suffered lesser damage, including collapsed fireplaces. Shortly after the main earthquake, the city dealt with a dozen water-main breaks and multiple natural-gas leaks, Stokes said. A water-main break flooded several floors of Brea City Hall, and the shaking knocked down computers and ceiling tiles, Stokes said. It was not immediately clear if City Hall would reopen Monday. An email to the mayor was not immediately returned. Friday's jolt was the strongest to strike the greater Los Angeles region since 2008. Southern California has been in a seismic lull since the deadly 1994 Northridge earthquake killed several dozen people and caused $25 billion in damage. The latest quake hit a week after a magnitude-4.4 temblor centered in the San Fernando Valley shook buildings and rattled nerves. It appeared to break a 1-mile segment of the Puente Hills thrust fault, which stretches from the San Gabriel Valley to downtown Los Angeles and caused the 1987 Whittier Narrows quake that killed eight people. The rupture lasted half a second, scientists said. U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Lucy Jones said it's unclear whether Southern California is entering a more active seismic period. \"We have been in a really quiet time. It can't stay that way,\" Jones said. A day after the magnitude-5.1 quake, Peter Novahof went shopping with his family at a hardware store in Long Beach.

{"text": "(Reuters) - Residents of southern California were rattled by a 4.1 magnitude earthquake Saturday afternoon, the largest of more than 100 aftershocks following Friday's 5.1 rumbler that caused light scattered damage around the Los Angeles area. Saturday's quake rippled through an area near Rowland Heights, California, about 2:32 p.m., according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The temblor was considered relatively shallow with a depth of 5.6 miles, the USGS said. Aftershocks are expected following earthquakes, according to the USGS. Seismologists said there was about a 5 percent chance that Friday's quake, which struck at 9:09 p.m., was a foreshock to a bigger temblor. No injuries were immediately reported from either Saturday's quake or the more significant earthquake that struck Friday evening outside La Habra, California, which is about 20 miles east of downtown Los Angeles. Friday's temblor displaced at least 50 people in Fullerton, about 5 miles from the epicenter, because of minor damage to homes and apartment dwellings, Fullerton Police Lieutenant Mike Chlebowski said. As well, a water main break in the city forced the closure of some streets due to flooding, he said. The quake also shook items off tables, rattled chandeliers and resulted in scattered damage to cars and property, including setting off a rockslide in the Orange County city of Brea that flipped a car on its roof. Friday's quake was felt as far away as Palm Springs in the east, San Diego in the south and Ventura County to the north. While not large, the event \"seems unusual, of course, because a lot of people felt it,\" said Doug Given, a USGS geophysicist. \"These quakes occur in populated areas and people try to put two and two together and predict that something more is coming, but that's simply not the case,\" he said.

Emergency services said on Friday they had calls about gas leaks and water main breaks, while some residents said objects fell from walls and shelves, but there were no immediate reports of injuries. Disneyland shut down rides as a precaution, according to NBC4 television, while Twitter users reported that some people left the park. A spokesman could did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The quake's epicentre was near La Habra, about 22 miles (35km) southeast of downtown Los Angeles, and could be felt across the LA metropolitan area, including in Hollywood. Car alarms were reported to have been set off in some areas by the five-mile-deep quake, which was initially registered as 5.3 magnitude but later revised down. The quake, which was preceded and followed by a number of smaller ones, came after a 4.4-magnitude earthquake jolted Angelenos out of bed on March 17. Friday's quake was felt in Los Angeles as a lower rumbling, which lasted up to half a minute, rather than a sharp jolt. The LA County Fire Department received some reports of gas leaks and scattered damage, said spokesman Ed Pickett, while police in Fullerton, about fives miles from La Habra, reported several water main breaks, spokesman Jeff Stuart told KCAL 9 television.

Southern California Edison reported power outages to about 2,000 customers following the quake. The tremor struck at 9.09pm and was centered near Brea in Orange County, about 20 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles, at a depth of 5 miles. It was felt as far south as San Diego and as far north as Ventura County, according to citizen responses collected online by the US Geological Survey (USGS). More than 100 aftershocks followed, including a magnitude-3.4 shock that hit on Saturday morning. The main shock was preceded by two foreshocks registering magnitudes 3.6 and 2.1, scientists said. Aftershocks were still being recorded by the USGS early on Saturday, nearly 12 hours after the quake struck. But the Los Angeles Fire Department said it had called off its \"earthquake mode\". \"Fortunately no significant damage occurred in the 470 square mile jurisdiction,\" the department said.

I'm not sure if the folks felt it, but we certainly felt it here in press box row,\" Scully said. \"A tremor and only that, thank goodness.\" Public safety officials said crews were inspecting bridges, dams, rail tracks and other infrastructure systems for signs of damage. The Brea police department said the rock slide in the Carbon Canyon area caused a car to overturn, and the people inside sustained minor injuries. Callers to KNX-AM reported seeing a brick wall collapse, water sloshing in a swimming pool and wires and trees swaying back and forth. One caller said he was in a movie theater lobby in Brea when the quake struck and said people ran outside and hugged in the street. Rides were halted at Disneyland in Anaheim, but no damage was found and the theme park was expected to have normal operations Saturday. The quake hit a week after a pre-dawn magnitude-4.4 quake centered in the San Fernando Valley rattled a swath of Southern California. That jolt shook buildings and rattled nerves but did not cause significant damage. Friday's \"earthquake is the second in two weeks, and reminds us to be prepared,\" Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said in a statement. Southern California has not experienced a devastating earthquake since the 1994 magnitude-6.7 Northridge quake killed several dozen people and caused $25 billion in damage.

The temblorXthe second moderate quake that rattled the city in two weeks after two decades of relative quiet since 1994's deadly Northridge quakeXonce again shook Los Angeles to attention. The magnitude 5.1 quake was followed by about a half dozen smaller quakes, or aftershocks. Shaking lasted for an extended time, rattling homes from the valleys to the shore. By 10 p.m., Los Angeles city and county officials had completed checks and found no major damage. No injuries or deaths were reported. A city official in La Habra, where the quake was centered, said one neighborhood was without power. Disneyland canceled its fireworks show because of the quake, and stopped rides as a precaution, according to local news.

{"text": "(Reuters) - Japan could try to rescue its Antarctic whaling program by sharply reducing catch quotas after the highest U.N. court ordered a halt, rejecting Tokyo's argument that the catch was for scientific purposes and not mainly for human consumption. The judgment by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) was a blow to Japan's decades-old \"scientific whaling\" program, although Tokyo, which said it would abide by the ruling, might be able to resume Antarctic whaling if it devises a new, more persuasive program that requires killing whales. \"We want to accept this from a position that respects the international legal order,\" Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters. \"We want to properly consider our country's response after carefully examining the contents of the ruling.\" The ICJ agreed with plaintiff Australia's position that the scientific research resulting from the Antarctic whaling did not justify the number of whales killed. Japan has long maintained that most whale species are in no danger of extinction and scientific whaling is necessary to manage what it sees as a marine resource that, after World War Two, was an important protein source for an impoverished nation. But with its whaling fleet in need of refurbishing and consumer interest in whale meat low, some observers said the court ruling might give the government the chance to abandon an expensive program - and improve its international standing. One of the most likely possibilities, though, is that Tokyo will submit a revamped research whaling program for approval by the International Whaling Commission (IWC), which oversees international management of whales. \"One thing Japan needs to do is make its scientific goals match the number of whales that it takes,\" said Masayuki Komatsu, formerly Japan's chief whaling negotiator. \"It's actually okay to hunt even more whales. But what will happen is that the number of whales taken will decrease,\" added Komatsu, now a visiting research professor at the International Centre for the Study of East Asian Development. More than half of IWC members oppose whaling, a situation that has long prompted Japan to call the body \"dysfunctional,\" so obtaining approval for any new proposals could be tough, Japanese media said. The U.N. tribunal said no further licenses should be issued for scientific whaling, in which animals are first examined for research purposes before the meat is sold. \"The research objectives must be sufficient to justify the lethal sampling,\" said Presiding Judge Peter Tomka of Slovakia. Japan also conducts separate hunts in the northern Pacific, while its fishermen engage in small-scale coastal whaling. An annual dolphin slaughter has also drawn harsh global criticism. Japan signed a 1986 ban on whaling but has continued to hunt up to 850 minke whales in the icy waters of the Southern Ocean, as well as smaller numbers of fin and humpback whales, citing a 1946 treaty that permits killing the giant mammals for research. The research whaling is needed to assess whether whale stocks are recovering from overfishing, Japan has said. Whaling was once widespread around the world but Japan is now one of only a handful of countries, including Iceland and Norway, that keep it up on a large scale. But despite the fact that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe himself hails from one of Japan's whaling regions, the ruling might not be entirely unwelcome in some parts of the government, said Jun Morikawa, who has written on whaling and politics in Japan. \"It was an unexpected decision but if they say they accept it there are no other options,\" said Morikawa, a professor at Rakuno Gakuen University in the northern island of Hokkaido. \"I get the impression that a lot of people in government may be relieved ... It gives them a chance to stop, they can say that Japan fought hard but now needs to accept the result.\"", "label": {"what": ["Japan could try to rescue its Antarctic whaling program by sharply reducing catch quotas after the highest U.N. court ordered a halt, rejecting Tokyo's argument that the catch was for scientific purposes and not mainly for human consumption."], "when": ["decades", "after World War Two", "1986", "1946"], "where": ["The ICJ", "Australia", "Japan's whaling regions"], "why": ["human consumption", "overfishing"], "who": ["Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida", "reporters", "some observers", "Shinzo Abe", "Morikawa"], "how": ["devises a new, more persuasive program", "make its scientific goals match the number of whales that it takes"], "charges": ["the court ruling might give the government the chance to abandon an expensive program - and improve its international standing", "no further licenses should be issued for scientific whaling"], "plead": ["We want to accept this from a position that respects the international legal order, Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters.", "We want to properly consider our country's response after carefully examining the contents of the ruling."], "sentence": ["no further licenses should be issued for scientific whaling", "signed a 1986 ban on whaling"]}}

{"text": "Japan is \"deeply disappointed\" that the UN's top court has ruled in favour of Australia by declaring its Southern Ocean whale hunt illegal, but nevertheless insists it will abide by the decision. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) on Monday demanded Japan cease its whaling program \"with immediate effect\" as it didn't comply with the country's obligations under the international whaling convention. The court agreed with Australia's long-held view that Japan's JARPA II research program wasn't \"for purposes of scientific research\" as allowed under Article 8 of the 1946 convention. The Australian government welcomed the historic win, but stressed it would have no effect on diplomatic and trade ties with Japan. Tokyo's agent at the ICJ, Koji Tsuruoka, addressed the world's media at the Peace Palace in The Hague after the judgment. \"Japan regrets and is deeply disappointed that JARPA II ... has been ruled by the court as not falling within the provisions of Article 8,\" he told reporters. \"However, as a state that respects the rule of law, the order of international law and as a responsible member of the global community, Japan will abide by the decision of the court.\" Mr Tsuruoka refused to discuss whether Japan would design a new research program in the hope of resuming whaling at a later date. He said Japan would digest the complex judgment before officials would \"be able to consider what future course of action we should take\". Australia's agent, Bill Campbell QC, welcomed the decision, but emphasised differences over whaling wouldn't impact on the overall bilateral relationship between Canberra and Tokyo. \"The decision of the court today, important as it is, has given us the opportunity to draw a line under the legal dispute and move on,\" Mr Campbell said. Monday's judgment comes seven years after then-opposition leader Kevin Rudd first pledged a future Labor government would take legal action against Tokyo. Rudd was duly elected prime minister in November 2007, but it took another 18 months before the government instituted proceedings in mid-2010. Current Labor deputy leader Tanya Plibersek said Monday's ruling meant a program which saw thousands of whales killed in Antarctic waters had at last been ended. \"The (coalition) government should now take up discussions with Japan to co-operate on genuine and non-lethal methods of whaling research,\" she said. The court criticised Japan for not focusing more on research methods that didn't involve killing whales. Prime Minister Tony Abbott travels to Japan in early April and will meet with his counterpart, Shinzo Abe, in an attempt to finalise a free trade agreement. A Japanese delegation spokesman in The Hague told AAP it wasn't yet known if the pair would discuss whaling. \"But we are thinking Mr Abbott's visit to Japan is with a view to strengthening our ties,\" Noriyuki Shikata said. Australia had argued before the 16-judge ICJ panel that Tokyo was cloaking a commercial whaling operation \"in the lab coat of science\" despite agreeing to a 1980s ban on harpooning. Japan, however, countered during a three-week hearing in mid-2013 that the court didn't have the authority to decide what was, or wasn't, science. But the court on Monday dismissed Tokyo's argument.

Far below us, heading for its honorary home port in Hobart after another season spent in the Southern Ocean combating the Japanese whalers, was the Bob Barker, Sea Shepherd's flagship, \"back from saving our whales\", said Fin, our young pilot. For Australians, today's victory in the International Court of Justice V that Japan \"has not acted in conformity with several clauses of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling\" V is an almost personal one. But for the rest of us, the judgment is equally important in the ongoing battle between economic and environmental forces. Whose whales are they anyway? From sentient marine mammals to apparently downed airliners and the drastic effects of climate change, the world's oceans, and what we do to them, may be the last great battleground. In Australia, the issues over whaling seem cut and dried. From the mother-and-calf humpback skeletons that hang like talismans over Sydney's Darling Harbour to the living whales which swim up and down the continent's coasts on their twice-annual migratory routes, there's a real and emotional attachment to these southern leviathans. Not least because, more than anywhere else, Australia is witness to the benefits of the 1983 moratorium on the hunting of great whales, as implemented by the International Whaling Commission. As the captain of a Sydney whalewatch boat boasted to me, there's a 10% increase in new calves being brought back into Australian waters, year on year (although they are certainly not all surviving). And this past season, no fewer than six whales found their way into Sydney Harbour. Perhaps they felt a sense of asylum there. Sea Shepherd enjoys extraordinary support in Australia. And yet V there's an historical and far more ambivalent context to note here, one that echoes the tensions between east and west. Japan's claim to commercial whaling as a cultural expression is surely a shaky one, since it only began large-scale whaling in the 20th century V but it was taught to them by European whalers. Then came the second world war and the horrors of the nuclear bomb. Having reduced the Japanese nation to submission, the occupying Allied powers turned decommissioned Japanese vessels into whaling ships, and V with western observers aboard V were sent out to kill whales and use their meat to feed a starving nation. Now we turn around and tell them it's all wrong. The Japanese fear that their fishing industry is next (quite rightly: fishing blue-fin tuna is close to sending the species extinct). And they point out that the US, fierce upholder of the 1983 moratorium, undermines its moral position by allowing indigenous Inuit to hunt bowhead whales in the Arctic. While the primary targets of the Japanese, like the Norwegians, are minke whales, so plentiful that they call them the cockroaches of the sea, (there may be up to 1.5 million minkes in the oceans), bowheads are rare, and with extraordinary lifetimes of up to 300 years, making them the longest living mammals. Meanwhile, here in the west, unchallenged by international courts, Norway, Iceland and Greenland continue whaling. In the Faroes, in \"European\" waters, thousands of pilot whales die each year, driven from the open Atlantic on to the islands' beaches and butchered. What will today's decision mean for these whale hunts being carried out on our own doorstep? Many more whales and dolphins die each year through pollution, bycatch, ship-strike: who is going to legislate for them? At the recent Encountering the Anthropocene conference convened by the University of Sydney, an Indigenous elder described to me some of the allusive stories of his people's empathetic relationships with whales. Once on land, humpbacks took human form and did good, and evil. These animals were not impossible symbols of righteousness, but sinners, like ourselves. There was no Manichean divide, but a subtler sense of our relationship to other sentient animals, the narrative we share. Perhaps that's the message we need to take away from today's result: none of us can occupy the unsteady moral high ground without looking down into the depths.", "label": {"what": ["Flying high over the Derwent, our tiny aircraft, bound for the Tasmanian south-west wilderness, almost tipped its wings in salute", "sentient marine mammals to apparently downed airliners and the drastic effects of climate change", "the world's oceans, and what we do to them, may be the last great battleground"], "when": ["after another season", "twice-annual", "1983", "this past season", "the second world war", "300 years"], "where": ["the world's oceans", "In Australia", "into Sydney Harbour", "in the west"], "why": ["combating the Japanese whalers", "whales and dolphins die each year through pollution, bycatch, ship-strike", "echoes the tensions between east and west"], "who": ["Fin", "Bob Barker", "Australians,captain", "European whalers", "V with western observers", "the US"], "how": ["back from saving our whales", "the 1983 moratorium on the hunting of great whales", "a 10% increase in new calves being brought back into Australian waters", "people's empathetic relationships with whales"], "charges": ["Japan has not acted in conformity with several clauses of the International Convention", "the issues over whaling"], "plead": ["battle between economic and environmental forces", "Japan's claim to commercial whaling as a cultural expression"], "sentence": ["Many more whales and dolphins die each year through pollution, bycatch, ship-strike: who is going to legislate for them"]}}
{"text": "The International Court of Justice has ordered a temporary halt to Japan's annual slaughter of whales in the Southern Ocean after concluding that the hunts are not, as Japan claims, conducted for scientific research. The UN court's decision, by a 12-4 majority among a panel of judges, casts serious doubt over the long-term future of the jewel in the crown of Japan's controversial whaling programme. It also marks a dramatic victory for the Australian government, whose four-year campaign to ban the hunts rested on whether it could convince the court that Japan was using scientific research as a cover for commercial whaling. In its 2010 application to the court, Australia accused Japan of failing to \"observe in good faith the zero catch limit in relation to the killing of whales\". Under the International Whaling Commission's 1986 ban on commercial whaling, Japan was permitted to kill a certain number of whales every year for what it called scientific research. The sale of meat from the hunts in restaurants and supermarkets, while not illegal, prompted accusations from Australia and other anti-whaling nations that Japan was cloaking a commercial operation \"in the lab coat of science\". In a lengthy ruling, the presiding judge in the Hague, Peter Tomka, said Japan had failed to prove that its pursuit of hundreds of mainly minke whales in Antarctic waters every winter V under a programme known as Jarpa II V was for scientific purposes. \"The evidence does not establish that the programme's design and implementation are reasonable in relation to achieving its stated objectives,\" Tomka said. \"The court concludes that the special permits granted by Japan for the killing, taking and treating of whales in connection with Jarpa II are not for purposes of scientific research,\" he added, before ordering Japan to cease its whaling programme \"with immediate effect\". Noriyuki Shikata, a spokesman for the Japanese delegation to the ICJ, said Japan was \"disappointed\" by the court's decision but would abide by it \"as a state that places great importance on the international legal order and the rule of law as a basis of the international \ncommunity.\" \"In terms of a future course of action, people in Tokyo will examine that, but we have made our position clear - that we will abide by the judgment,\" Shikata told the Guardian. He said the ruling would not affect bilateral ties with Australia. \"Japan and Australia are close economic and strategic partners with shared values and interests,\" he said. \"We enjoy mature bilateral relations in many areas, so now it is important to ensure that our differences over whaling do not affect very good Japan-Australia relations as a whole.\" Shikata said he did not interpret today's verdict as an attack on Japan's culture. \"We made references to cultural differences and dietary traditions, but this case was about the legality of the programme under the whaling convention,\" he said. \"The court ruling referred, for example, to a lack of scientific basis for sample sizes ... it wasn't about cultural differences.\" Campaigners welcomed the ruling. \"This is an historic decision which lays to rest, once and for all, the grim travesty of Japan's so-called 'scientific' whaling and exposes it to the world as the blatant falsehood it clearly is,\" said Clare Perry, head of the cetaceans campaign at the UK-based Environmental Investigation Agency. \"With this ruling, Japan must clearly cease its whaling activities in the Antarctic.\" The court ruled that Japan had not complied with its obligations covering scientific research as set out in article 8 of the 1946 International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling. Japan, though, had maintained that its annual slaughter of 850 minke whales and up to 50 endangered fin whales every year was necessary to examine the age, health, feeding habits, exposure to toxins and other characteristics of whale populations, with a view to the possible resumption of sustainable commercial whaling. Officials in Tokyo said the data could not be obtained through non-lethal methods. Tomka, however, said Japan had not offered sufficient scientific justification for the slaughter of a large number of minke whales, while failing to kill enough fin and humpback whales to be of any scientific value. It had also failed to explore the possibility of gathering certain scientific data without resorting to killing the mammals, he added. In its defence, Japan cited only two peer-reviewed scientific papers relating to its program from 2005 to the present, during which it has harpooned 3,600 minke whales, a handful of fin whales, and no humpback whales. Tuesday's decision, though, leaves room for Japan to revamp its whaling programme to meet an international whaling treaty's requirements for scientific whaling. And it does not mean the end to all whaling. Japan also hunts a much smaller number of whales in the northern Pacific, while Norway and Iceland continue to kill whales for their commercial value, in defiance of the IWC ban. Japan has slaughtered more than 10,000 whales since the IWC moratorium came into effect, according to the Australian government. Japan had questioned the court's right to rule on the case, but said before the ruling that it would accept its verdict. The court's judgements are binding and cannot be appealed. Monday's ruling is unlikely to have much impact on the Japanese public, whose appetite for whale meat has declined dramatically since the immediate postwar period. In recent years, stocks of whale meat have remained unsold, with almost 4,600 tonnes stored in port freezers at the end of 2012, according to Japanese government statistics. Campaigners said they hoped the verdict would result in a permanent end to Japan's whaling programme in the southern ocean. \"The myth that this hunt was in any way scientific can now be dismissed once and for all,\" said Willie MacKenzie, oceans campaigner for Greenpeace UK. \"We urge Japan to abide by this decision and not attempt to continue whaling through any newly invented loopholes.\"", "label": {"what": ["The International Court of Justice has ordered a temporary halt to Japan's annual slaughter of whales in the Southern Ocean after concluding that the hunts are not", "Japan claims, conducted for scientific research"], "when": ["2010", "1986", "1946", "Tuesday", "at the end of 2012"], "where": ["Japan", "at the UK-based Environmental Investigation Agency", "in the northern Pacific"], "why": ["slaughter of whales", "this case was about the legality of the programme under the whaling convention"], "who": ["Peter Tomka", "Noriyuki Shikata", "Officials in Tokyo"], "how": ["Australian government, whose four-year campaign to ban the hunts", "Japan must clearly cease its whaling activities in the Antarctic", "We urge Japan to abide by this decision and not attempt to continue whaling through any newly invented loopholes."], "charges": ["concluding that the hunts are not, as Japan claims, conducted for scientific research", "observe in good faith the zero catch limit in relation to the killing of whales", "The sale of meat from the hunts in restaurants and supermarkets, while not illegal, prompted accusations from Australia and other anti-whaling nations", "Japan was cloaking a commercial operation in the lab coat of science", "The court ruled that Japan had not complied with its obligations covering scientific research as set out in article 8 of the 1946 International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling."], "plead": ["Japan was using scientific research as a cover for commercial whaling", "Japan, though, had maintained that its annual slaughter of 850 minke whales and up to 50 endangered fin whales every year was necessary to examine the age, health, feeding habits, exposure to toxins and other characteristics of whale populations,", "with a view to the possible resumption of sustainable commercial whaling"], "sentence": ["a temporary halt to Japan's annual slaughter of whales in the Southern Ocean", "failed to prove that its pursuit of hundreds of mainly minke whales in Antarctic waters every winter V under a programme known as Jarpa II V was for scientific purposes", "today's verdict as an attack on Japan's culture."]}}
{"text": "TOKYO   The decision to ban Japan s annual whaling drive off Antarctica, handed down by the United Nations  highest court on Monday, was a hard-won victory for conservationists who long argued that Tokyo s whaling research was a cover for commercial whaling. The ruling by the International Court of Justice in The Hague halts a Japanese program that has captured more than 10,000 minke and other whales in the Southern Ocean since 1988 in the name of biological research. Japan may not be ready to lay down its harpoons entirely. Though the ruling is final, it allows the Japanese to continue to hunt whales under a redesigned program, said Nanami Kurasawa, who heads a marine conservation group in Tokyo. And the court s decision does not affect smaller hunts that Japan carries out in the northern Pacific, or coastal whaling carried out on a smaller scale by local fishermen. It s an important decision, but it also leaves the Japanese government a lot of leeway,  Ms. Kurasawa said.  The Japanese government could start research whaling again but under a different name, and it would be out of the ruling s purview. In a 12-to-4 judgment, the court found that Japan was in breach of its international obligations by catching and killing minke whales and issuing permits for hunting humpback and fin whales within the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, established by the International Whaling Commission. Reading a summary of the judgment, the presiding judge, Peter Tomka of Slovakia, said that the latest Japanese program, which was expanded in 2005, had involved the killing of thousands of minke whales and a number of fin whales, but that its  scientific output to date appears limited.  The ruling suggested that Japan s whaling hunt was based on politics and logistics, rather than science. Lawyers attending the proceedings said there was a gasp among the audience when Judge Tomka ordered Japan to immediately  revoke all whaling permits  and not issue any new ones under the existing program. I rarely heard such an unequivocal, strong ruling at this court,  said a lawyer with long experience at the court who asked not to be named because he is working on a case in progress. A Japanese foreign ministry spokesman, Noriyuki Shikata, was quoted in news reports as telling reporters in The Hague that the country  regrets and is deeply disappointed  by the decision. But he also was quoted as saying that Japan respected the rule of law and would abide by the decision. The ruling drew praise from environmental groups, including the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, which has sent ships to the remote and icy waters to block and harass Japan s whaling fleet. We are very happy with the backing of the International Court,  Geert Vons, a representative of Sea Shepherd, said after leaving the courtroom.  We had never expected such a strong ruling. Australia, a former whaling country, brought the suit against Japan in 2010, accusing the country of using a loophole to get around a 1986 worldwide moratorium on commercial whaling. Despite the moratorium, Japan has captured and killed more than 10,000 whales in what Tokyo describes as efforts to collect data to monitor the impact of whales on Japan s fishing industry and to study the health and habitat of the whale population. To pay for the government program, the meat from the culled whales is sold and makes its way to supermarkets, restaurants and schools. Still, Japan s whaling program has struggled financially in recent years, as more Japanese consumers turn up their noses at whale meat and as environmental activists chasing whaling boats make the hunts more difficult. Hunts in recent years have relied on public subsidies, including money drawn from funds earmarked for Japan s post-tsunami reconstruction. Some critics said Monday s decision presented Japan with an opportunity to bow out of a practice that has become a drain on its finances, as well as a blow to its image abroad. This might be a good time to quit,  said Toshio Kasuya, an early collaborator on Japan s research program who has since become one of its harshest critics. From early on, it became clear to researchers that the program did not prioritize scientific discovery, he said. The system is bankrupt,  Mr. Kasuya said. Whaling is defended by some Japanese, however, who feel unfairly singled out by international criticism and who argue that the hunts are a Japanese tradition. These supporters make little pretense that whaling is carried out for science. Some people eat beef, others eat whale. We should respect all cultures,  said Komei Wani, who leads the Group to Preserve Whale Dietary Culture, based in the whaling town of Shimonoseki.  As long as there are enough whales to go around, why can t we hunt a few?", "label": {"what": ["The decision to ban Japan\u2019s annual whaling drive off Antarctica, handed down by the United Nations\u2019 highest court on Monday, was a hard-won victory for conservationists who long argued that Tokyo s whaling research was a cover for commercial whaling", "the court\u2019s decision does not affect smaller hunts that Japan carries out in the northern Pacific, or coastal whaling carried out on a smaller scale by local fishermen", "that the latest Japanese program, which was expanded in 2005, had involved the killing of thousands of minke whales and a number of fin whales"], "when": ["on Monday", "since 1988", "Monday", "From early on"], "where": ["in the Southern Ocean", "off Antarctica", "in the whaling town of Shimonoseki"], "why": ["has captured more than 10,000 minke and other whales in the Southern Ocean since 1988 in the name of biological research", "To pay for the government program, the meat from the culled whales is sold and makes its way to supermarkets, restaurants and schools"], "who": ["the United Nations", "Nanami Kurasawa", "Shikata Noriyuki", "Geert Vons"], "how": ["the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, which has sent ships to the remote and icy waters to block and harass Japan\u2019s whaling fleet", "The ruling suggested that Japan s whaling hunt was based on politics and logistics, rather than science."], "charges": ["a Japanese program that has captured more than 10,000 minke and other whales in the Southern Ocean since 1988 in the name of biological research", "In a 12-to-4 judgment, the court found that Japan was in breach of its international obligations by catching and killing minke whales and issuing permits for hunting humpback and fin whales", "within the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, established by the International Whaling Commission"], "plead": ["it allows the Japanese to continue to hunt whales under a redesigned program", "We should respect all cultures", "Whaling is defended by some Japanese, however, who feel unfairly singled out by international criticism and who argue that the hunts are a Japanese tradition"], "sentence": ["ban Japan s annual whaling drive off Antarctica", "halts a Japanese program that has captured more than 10,000 minke and other whales in the Southern Ocean since 1988 in the name of biological research"]}}

Australia brought the case against Japan to end whaling in the icy Southern Ocean. Japan hunts around a thousand mostly minke whales each year as part of what it claims is a scientific programme. But Australia and environmental groups dispute this, arguing it is just a way for Japan to get around a moratorium on commercial whaling imposed by the International Whaling Commission in 1986. The meat, considered a delicacy by some in Japan, is sold commercially. Reading a judgement by the Hague-based International Court of Justice, presiding judge Peter Tomka of Slovakia said Japan has not justified the large number of minke whales it takes, while failing to meet much smaller targets for fin and humpback whales.

{"text": "Judges at the highest UN court ordered Japan on Monday to halt whaling in the Antarctic, rejecting the countrys long-held argument that the catch was for scientific purposes and not primarily for human consumption. Tokyo said it was disappointed but would abide by the decision, while activists said they hoped it would bring closer a complete end to whaling around the world. The International Court of Justice sided with plaintiff Australia in finding that the scientific output of the whaling programme did not justify the number of whales killed. The tribunal said no further licences should be issued for scientific whaling, where animals are first examined for research purposes before the meat is sold to consumers. In light of the fact the JARPA II [research programme] has been going on since 2005, and has involved the killing of about 3,600 minke whales, the scientific output to date appears limited, Presiding Judge Peter Tomka of Slovakia said. Japan signed a 1986 moratorium on whaling, but has continued to hunt up to 850 minke whales in the icy waters of the Southern Ocean, as well as smaller numbers of fin and humpback whales, citing a 1946 treaty that permits killing the giant mammals for research. Japan was deeply disappointed by the ruling, but it would comply, said Koji Tsuruoka, the countrys chief lawyer before the court. He said the government would need to study the ruling before taking any further action. Judges agreed with Australia that the research V two peer reviewed papers since 2005, based on results obtained from just nine killed whales V was not proportionate to the number of animals killed. The judgment is an embarrassment to Japan, but Tokyo could continue whaling if it devised a new, more persuasive programme of scientific that required lethal catch of whales, or if it withdrew from the whaling moratorium or the 1946 International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling. Whaling was once widespread around the world, but Japan is now one of only three countries, alongside Iceland and Norway, that continue the practice. The meat is popular with Japanese consumers who consider it a delicacy. Norway, the other main whaling nation, in 1993 shifted away from scientific whaling to commercial catches, where the meat is sold directly to consumers. Norway set a quota of 1,286 minke whales in the north Atlantic last years summer hunt, saying stocks are plentiful in the region. Fishermen rarely catch the full quota, partly because demand has sunk in recent years. Iceland and Norway do not claim to be carrying out research, openly hunting whale meat for commercial purposes, meaning the ICJs ruling has no immediate consequences for them. But activists said the ruling reflected a gradually changing climate that would put an end to whaling.

{"text": "Hanoi: The developer of Flappy Bird, the former most popular free mobile game on the Apple Inc App Store and Google Inc's Android Play store, took the game down at midnight on Sunday as he announced he would do 22 hours earlier. The game is no longer available to download for either Apple or Google users, but its fans still can have fun with the bird if they already downloaded the game to their devices. Nguyen Ha Dong, a Hanoi-based game developer, announced the grounding of the addictive game in a Tweet at 1900 GMT on Saturday in which he also apologized to Flappy Bird players. \"Twenty-two hours from now, I will take 'Flappy Bird' down,\" Dong said, adding \"it is not anything related to legal issues. \"I cannot take this anymore,\" he wrote. His Tweet attracted more than 136,000 Retweets as of 0430 GMT on Monday. Flappy Bird caused a sensation after rising from obscurity to become one of the most downloaded mobile games on both Apple and Google's online stores. Users have to steer a bird between green pipes. The Android version has been downloaded up to 50 million times and attracted more than half a million reviews. Many people have been questioning Dong on Twitter about his decision to take down the game as only a day earlier he had been talking about developing the game for Microsoft's Windows phones. Dong could not be reached for comment. He turned his telephone off after cancelling an interview with Reuters on Thursday and not finalizing arrangements for one on Friday. Unlike other successful game makers like Rovio Entertainment, which produced the hugely popular Angry Birds game and has hundreds of programmers, Dong made Flappy Bird by himself in a few nights, he said on Twitter earlier. The game, which he said was inspired by Nintendo's Mario Bros, has been earning on average $50,000 a day from advertising, Dong said in a media interview. Two friends of Dong said Nintendo had sent him a warning letter, but the Japanese game maker said it was not considering a lawsuit. \"It sounds very much like a rumor and if it is, we certainly can't comment on that,\" Nintendo's media representative told Reuters on Friday. One gaming company manager said Dong's decision to take down the game was wise. \"Dong is taking one step back to avoid legal risk because it's too difficult to deal with legal issues himself if it happens,\" said Duy Doan, a senior manager at VTC Online, one of Vietnam's leading game companies.

{"text": "Those who missed out on the smartphone sensation hunt for it online - as Nintendo denies killing the in-demand app. Mobile and tablet devices pre-loaded with the popular app Flappy Bird have attracted bids of more than 83,000 on eBay, after the game was withdrawn by its creator. The hit game was removed from Apple's App Store and Google Play on Sunday by its Vietnamese inventor, Dong Nguyen, who had previously announced his decision on Twitter. Gamers that already have Flappy Birds on their mobiles are looking to exploit its popularity by offering their devices for sale on eBay, attracting bids from 400 to 83,000. It is not clear whether bids are genuine, but an eBay spokesman suggested they were unlikely to allow the transactions anyway. \"Ensuring a good customer experience is our top priority and we are in the process of removing listings for these devices, as they do not meet a number of our requirements,\" he said. \"In particular, devices such as tablets and mobiles must be completely reset to factory condition before being sold on eBay.\" The exact reason for the game's withdrawal is not known, but Nguyen indicated legal issues were not to blame. Nintendo also denied claims that a legal challenge it issued had led to the game's withdrawal. Spokesman Yasuhiro Minagawa told the Wall Street Journal: \"While we usually do not comment on the rumours and speculations, we have already denied the speculation.\" Launched in May 2013, the game was free to download and required players to tap the screen to keep the bird flying through an endless series of pipes. Despite its simple graphics, it was widely known as an extremely difficult game, since many users could only keep the bird in the air for seconds before it hit the ground. Flappy Bird was one of the most downloaded mobile games ever. It topped the free games charts on both Apple and Google's online stores, making it the year's most popular mobile game so far. The official game is no longer available to download online, but it still works on mobile devices that have previously installed it.

{"text": "The creator of Flappy Bird has removed the game from app stores, ostensibly unable to cope with the criticism. Why all the hate? Because its how successful games draw you in. Flappy Bird has flapped its last. It is an ex-bird. The minimalist pipe-avoidance sim that scorched to the top of the iPhone free game rankings earlier this year has been removed by its creator, Dong Nguyen. I am sorry Flappy Bird users, 22 hours from now, I will take Flappy Bird down, he tweeted. I cannot take this anymore. Some have seen in this a sort of victory for honest game design. Others have lambasted Nguyen for whining about earning a reported $50,000 a day from the game. Both responses are reductive and unfair. Flappy Bird was despised, at least in part, because of misunderstandings about how the games industry and game creators work. In case you have somehow missed out on the short flight of this fascinating game, Flappy Bird is a free-to-play smartphone title in which the challenge is to guide a cute bird character through a tunnel of pipes, varying its altitude so that it can slip through the gaps. The interface is simple V just keep tapping the screen to flap the wings V but the game is extraordinarily difficult. Many players take several minutes just to pass through the first pipe gate, and hours of concerted effort are required to get a score over ten. The reaction from gamers has been one of utter frustration mixed with the hopeless need to continue. People hate it, but they cant stop. Humble genius in a hateful system This infuriating ambiguity seems to have come as a shock to many observers. Last week, The Guardians own Stuart Heritage amusingly wrote about how he wanted to smash Flappy Bird into a pulp. But to me, a child of the 1980s who spent every seaside holiday pumping 10p pieces into brain-squelchingly tough arcade titles like Defender and Gunsmoke, Flappy Bird is just a continuation of a particularly unforgiving approach to game design. There is a long history behind this titles cheerful sadism. Video games are about precarious balance V they are machines of compulsion, and they require an operator who is engaged enough to keep cranking the handle but not too comfortable that they get bored and want to stop. One good way to ensure compulsion is to make the operator believe that they can always do better, and if they dont, that failure makes them angry enough at themselves to trap them in the loop. Early in his design career, Super Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto obsessively studied popular arcade titles like Pac-Man, trying to work out what made them so popular. He had an industrial design background and didnt understand the appeal. Eventually, everything clicked. I concluded that [it] was born of the players being mad at themselves, he once explained. So I would try to analyse how the game made players feel that way. What he learned was that players must very quickly understand the limits of their presence in the game world; that if the controls are simple and fair, interactions with complex systems start to become compulsive. But everything hinges on balance. Originally, the controllable character in Miyamotos classic arcade game Donkey Kong couldnt leap over incoming barrels, which made the controls easy, but rendered the experience impossibly difficult. However, adding a jump button made players feel more in control, while only very slightly increasing the complexity of the interface. Miyamoto achieved the balance he needed. After this, he continually iterated and tested the extract angle and height of the jump to ensure it was just right V that it was just easy enough to use, but still reliant on skill and timing. It needed to be perfect, it needed to be an exact science, and it was. Donkey Kong became an enormous success. Similarly, Flappy Bird is based around a simple interaction: press screen to flap wings. But it is clear that Nguyen has spent time working out the exact vertical lift achieved by this single input; just as he has got the gap between pipes exactly right. The alchemy of these different parts has created a machine that players feel they ought to be able to operate, and when they fail, they blame themselves. Once again, this is crucial V this is the kernel of compulsive game design, from Space Invaders to Call of Duty. A great game system turns a mirror on the players inefficiencies and errors. And Flappy Bird is great game design, when viewed at this molecular level. What makes Flappy Bird work particularly well is that it eliminates all extraneous complexity to focus on one very simple input mechanic, says game designer Bennett Foddy, who specialises in extremely unforgiving physics-based titles like Qwop and Girp. It also adds depth to that simple foundation using one extremely elegant and subtle innovation: the width of the barriers is just slightly wider than the half-width of your flap/jump. This forces you to make a series of difficult split-second decisions about whether and when to flap while youre inside the barriers. In my opinion this is a very small, humble piece of genius. Flappy Bird provides solid evidence that simply tuning a game well can be far more important, in terms of the players ultimate enjoyment, than adding clever mechanics or beautiful art. Super Mario Thieves So why do people outside of the games large userbase hate it so vociferously? One familiar response is that the game has ripped off its visuals from Super Mario Bros, that its character and pipe designs borrow heavily from Nintendos classic series. But then, video games have been appropriating elements of the Super Mario series for many years. The 1987 platformer Great Giana Sisters is an obvious tribute to the Nintendo titles, yet received critical adulation. Since then a whole online community has grown around illicit hacks of the Super Mario titles, with authors adding new features and complications and distributing their works online to much press interest. Theyre rarely for commercial gain, but yet in these cases, the act of remixing Mario elements is seen as a creative endeavour. The art elements are no closer to Marios actual artwork than thousands of other famous and lesser-known indie games that have been released over the past 20 or 30 years, says Foddy. Much of the criticism has focused on the green pipes that form the barriers in Flappy Bird X those green pipes have been cultural icons for three decades. Two of the most famous works in the indie games movement, Super Meat Boy and Braid, adapt language and visual elements from Super Mario Bros for exactly this reason, and quite rightly neither one faced anything like the kind of criticism that Flappy Bird has received. Others have pointed out the similarities between Flappy Bird and earlier examples such as Piou Piou and the old Flash title, Helicopter Game. The word clone is chucked about with abandon. In truth, the history of video game design is one in which inspiration and plagiarism have often been virtually indistinguishable. The big genres we know today have come about through developers taking ideas from successful releases, modifying them, and releasing new variations. Space Invaders begat Galaxian and many others, spawning the rich lineage of the space shoot-em-up; Tetris gave us a new era of block-sorting puzzlers; Minecraft borrowed elements from earlier building games like Infiniminer and Dwarf Fortress. The British games industry of the early 80s was practically created by the young coders who got hold of cheap computers and made their own versions of games like Donkey Kong and Pac-Man. This is how ideas spread and evolved. The truth is that Flappy Bird is a genre game, in one of the oldest genres of all, the forced-scrolling dodger, says Foddy. The roots of the genre go back to arcade games like Caverns of Mars, Jump Bug or Fly Boy from the very early 1980s, and there have been thousands upon thousands of similar games across the years, just as there have been thousands of falling-block games inspired by Tetris, and thousands of vertical shooters inspired by Space Invaders. One of my favourite indie games, Thrustburst, is very close in gameplay to Flappy Bird. Clone wars Of course, there have been deliberate attempts to misdirect gamers toward titles that are virtually identical to successful products V if only in name. This is now a common occurrence on smartphone app stores where unscrupulous developers will produce titles that mimic big sellers almost completely, taking advantage of a store where buying decisions are obfuscated behind difficult-to-use search options. This is what we mean by cloning V it is a business rather than game design practice. It is the reason why major publisher King felt it necessary to trademark the word Candy; the company wanted to protect its successful puzzler Candy Crush Saga from dozens of copycats. But then, in game design terms, Candy Crush owes much to other match three titles like Bejeweled, which owes much to Puyo Pop, which owes much to Tetris, and on and on, back through the complex history of design and inspiration. \n\nIts something a few game designers have picked up on. On Sunday morning, Robert Yang, a teacher at the NYU Game Center tweeted: And from Sophie Houlden, a comparison with the recent uproar over Candy Crush Saga: Aside from design, there are the economic objections. There are criticisms of the fact that Flappy Bird is overloaded with adverts V and true, the screen is awash with them. But then, if you hate that, youre really expressing frustration at a marketplace in which free-to-play has become the only viable option for many designers. In the smartphone market, most players baulk at spending as little as 69p on a game that may have taken someone months to program, test and release. But 69p is a third of the cost of a Starbucks latte, a purchase many of us make almost by instinct every workday morning. Ive actually heard from developers who say they have received death threats when seeking to charge a couple of pounds for add-on packs or new levels for their smartphone titles. So you dont charge. But then how do you make money? You either start building your titles around microtransactions, asking players to pay out for customising their characters or getting around the time barriers artificially installed between game levels, or you sign up with an advertising platform and display ads on screen. Some players dislike both, but they dislike paying upfront too. You cant win. Although of course, Nguyen has won. He was making a reported $50k a day from ad revenue, provoking even more fury. Such riches from a game thats barely his own V and now his inability to cope is read as whiny ingratitude. There have been suggestions that he used bots to post fake reviews and artificially boost the game up the App Store rankings. Certainly the meteoric rise of the title looks suspicious; it usually takes many months to build from utter obscurity to chart success. Rumours persist that Flappy Birds removal was forced, although Nguyen denies legal pressure. We may never know. Lurking behind it all is the shadow of xenophobia. Perhaps if Nguyen had been called, say, Jake Stern, perhaps if hed been a USC student or a San Francisco media hipster everything would be okay. Then critics may have referred to his project as a pastiche of Super Mario or a new entry into the cultish masocore genre like respected indie title I Wanna Be The guy, which references Metroid, Mega Man and Castlevania rather than stealing from them. But no, Nguyen is from Vietnam in Asia, a region hazily associated with counterfeit consumer goods and online fantasy game gold farming. As game designer Merritt Kopas put it on Twitter: Flappy Birds is clearly a game that borrows heavily from predecessors in its confined sub-genre. Its visuals hark back to Mario, just as many other titles have done. But somehow V perhaps with the sort of illicit tactics a digital app store invites, perhaps not V the title exploded in popularity, bringing in money and millions of players. But it has been decided that the title is unworthy, that simply not downloading it isnt enough. The sometimes infinitesimal divide between genre entrant and clone has apparently been breached. I cannot take this anymore, wrote Dong Nguyen over the weekend. And unless this is the clever marketing scam that some are now theorising, he has learned the age-old lesson that success does not always bring happiness. No, sometimes success brings the opposite, and in these days of instant social media judgement, it brings it in force.", "label": {"what": ["The creator of Flappy Bird has removed the game from app stores", "Flappy Bird has flapped its last", "scorched to the top of the iPhone free game rankings", "Flappy Bird was despised", "Many players take several minutes just to pass through the first pipe gate", "hours of concerted effort are required to get a score over ten", "People hate it, but they cant stop", "Miyamoto achieved the balance he needed", "he continually iterated and tested the extract angle and height of the jump", "Nguyen has spent time working out the exact vertical lift achieved by this single input", "he has got the gap between pipes exactly right", "It also adds depth to that simple foundation", "the game has ripped off its visuals from Super Mario Bros", "its character and pipe designs borrow heavily from Nintendos classic series", "The British games industry of the early 80s was practically created by the young coders", "most players baulk at spending as little as 69p on a game that may have taken someone months to program, test and release", "they have received death threats when seeking to charge a couple of pounds for add-on packs or new levels for their smartphone titles", "He was making a reported $50k a day from ad revenue, provoking even more fury"], "when": ["earlier this year", "22 hours from now", "Last week", "the very early 1980s", "On Sunday morning"], "where": ["app stores", "inside the barriers", "at a marketplace", "Vietnam in Asia"], "why": ["Because its how successful games draw you in", "for whining about earning a reported $50,000 a day from the game", "because of misunderstandings about how the games industry and game creators work", "the players being mad at themselves", "to protect its successful puzzler Candy Crush Saga from dozens of copycats"], "who": ["creator, Dong Nguyen", "Flappy Bird users", "a cute bird character", "Many players", "gamers", "many observers", "The Guardians", "Stuart Heritage", "a child of the 1980s", "an operator", "creator Shigeru Miyamoto", "game designer Bennett Foddy", "unscrupulous developers", "Robert Yang, a teacher at the NYU Game Center", "Sophie Houlden", "Jake Stern", "a USC student", "a San Francisco media hipster", "game designer Merritt Kopas"], "how": ["guide a cute bird character through a tunnel of pipes, varying its altitude so that it can slip through the gaps", "keep tapping the screen to flap the wings", "using one extremely elegant and subtle innovation", "tuning a game", "developers taking ideas from successful releases, modifying them, and releasing new variations", "mimic big sellers almost completely", "taking advantage of a store where buying decisions are obfuscated behind difficult-to-use search options", "by cloning", "major publisher King", "illicit tactics a digital app store invites"], "product_name": ["Flappy Bird", "Defender", "Gunsmoke", "Super Mario", "Pac-Man", "Donkey Kong", "Space Invaders", "Call of Duty", "Qwop", "Girp", "Great Giana Sisters", "Super Meat Boy", "Braid", "Piou Piou", "Helicopter Game", "Space Invaders", "Galaxian", "Tetris", "Minecraft", "Infiniminer", "Dwarf Fortress", "Caverns of Mars", "Jump Bug or Fly Boy", "Thrustburst", "Bejeweled", "Puyo Pop", "I Wanna Be The guy", "Metroid", "Mega Man", "Castlevania", "gold farming"], "countermeasures": ["to make the operator believe that they can always do better, and if they dont, that failure makes them angry enough at themselves to trap them in the loop", "adding a jump button", "trademark the word Candy"], "new_features": ["a free-to-play smartphone title", "The interface is simple", "the game is extraordinarily difficult", "a simple interaction: press screen to flap wings", "compulsive game design", "it eliminates all extraneous complexity", "focus on one very simple input mechanic", "the width of the barriers is just slightly wider than the half-width of your flap/jump", "the forced-scrolling dodger", "borrows heavily from predecessors in its confined sub-genre"], "effects": ["players feel more in control, while only very slightly increasing the complexity of the interface", "easy enough to use, but still reliant on skill and timing", "make a series of difficult split-second decisions about whether and when to flap", "Flappy Bird is overloaded with adverts"]}}
{"text": "Legend has it that Pablo Picasso once said, Good artists borrow, great artists steal. In the case of Flappy Bird, the highly popular game that vanished from the Apple App Store over the weekend, it seems a lot of people are stealing. On the website Elance, which is a listings site for freelancer technologists, several dozen job listings asked for programmers to build Flappy Bird-like clone apps for the Apples iOS and the Android mobile platforms. Under a listing for an iOS Game Developer, the job requirements state a developer will be responsible for the full development of relatively simple games, with similar complexity to Flappy Birds. An app listing for an Android developer asked for someone who can create a very simple game similar to Flappy Bird, but using a very popular Copyrighted character owned by us. It was not clear which character would be used instead of a flapping bird. The ad said it would pay the developer from $500 to $1,000 to make the game. Some other listings are pretty blunt about stealing rather than borrowing. One ad titled, flappy bird clone with Ads, said it needed a developer to make a simple clone with PhoneGap for Flappy Bird Game and integrate Ads. The pay for the clone was less than $500. There are several clones that are already available in the iOS and Android app stores, including Fly Birdie, Flappy Bee, Flappy Plane and Ironpants, which are all remarkably similar in design and gameplay, but use other characters instead of the Flappy Bird bird. Flappy Bird rose to the top of the most-downloaded-app charts for Apple and Android mobile devices during the past few weeks. As my colleague Nick Wingfield wrote on Sunday, the apps creator, Dong Nguyen, is an independent developer in Vietnam. He became an overnight sensation in the mobile app world because of the success of his games. From a financial standpoint, it makes sense that so many people are frantically trying to copy Flappy Bird. Mr. Nguyen told The Verge last week that he was making, on average, $50,000 a day from the advertisements shown inside the game. Apparently overcome with all the attention, Mr. Nguyen pulled the app from the app store, stating on Twitter, I cannot take this anymore. Before pulling the app from the store, Mr. Nguyen tweeted: I also dont sell Flappy Bird, please dont ask. It might not matter how good these clones become. The key could be how well they promote them. Over the weekend, a number of tech sites claimed that Mr. Nguyen had gamed the iOS App Store in order to bump up its ratings, which helped it gain attention in recent months. They accused him of doing it by using bots to write thousands of positive fake reviews of Flappy Bird. That goes against earlier statements made by Mr. Nguyen, who said in a recent interview with Chocolate Labs Apps, a game developer site, that Flappy Bird had become popular organically. I didnt use any promotion methods, he said. All accounts on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram about Flappy Bird are not mine. The popularity could be my luck. There are already free versions of Flappy Birds available online, usually surrounded by advertisements.

{"text": "HANOI X Until Sunday, the worlds most popular smartphone game was Flappy Bird, a simple but frustratingly difficult video game that was created by a developer in Vietnam. But just as its popularity soared, its creator abruptly removed the game from the marketplace. Surprisingly difficult and infuriatingly addictive, Flappy Bird has become a global sensation. Last week it became a top seller on both Apple iPhones and smartphones using the Google Android operating system. The game uses simple graphics, that reminded many of Nintendos Super Mario Brothers, a classic video game from the 1980s, players guide a flapping bird between broken pipes by tapping the screen. Smartphone games are big business, with many companies hiring teams of programmers to make the next hit. But indie developer Nguyen Ha Dong said it only took him a few days to create Flappy Bird. The success of the game was completely unexpected, and inexplicable, much like Korean popstar Psys smash hit \"Gangam Style,\" the editor of Tech-in-Asia, Anh Minh Do said. I talk about how everyone copies Angry Birds principles, and I think people will try to copy the principles of Flappy Bird. You know maybe Flappy Birds fame is not copyable. Maybe its one of those flukesK I think its very hard to replicate those moments, said Minh. But being shot to fame was apparently too much for the games 29-year-old creator, Hanoi native Nguyen Ha Dong. In a series of messages he published on Twitter in recent days, Dong revealed he was taking the game down because the attention was overwhelming. I can call Flappy Bird is a success of mine. But it also ruins my simple life. So now I hate it, he wrote. But although its \"Game Over\" for Flappy Bird, experts are hopeful Dongs legacy in Vietnam could be longer lasting. Vietnam is the largest online games market by value in South-East Asia, with revenue of over $250 million in 2013. The local market is dominated by VNG, which holds 60 percent of the Vietnamese gaming market.  But Dong is one of thousands of upcoming independent developers, who mostly focus on creating mobile games. Despite that competition, Tech In Asias Minh said the quality of the games they produce tends to be low. Not that many of them are world class and not that many of them are going after the global market. If youre going for the global market then you have to be way better, he said. In Vietnam, games are very expensive to develop and are hindered by complicated licensing procedures. The result is most Vietnamese gamers play foreign games, particularly from China, which are adapted for the local market. Do Quy Doan, who recently retired as deputy minister of communication, said the games industry in Vietnam is still new and there are still obstacles as well as mechanisms to encourage it. Doan said the success of Flappy Bird is very encouraging for the future of the games industry. In the meantime, whether he likes it or not, the spotlight is likely to remain on Flappy Birds creator Nguyen Ha Dong, even though his game is no longer available to download.", "label": {"what": ["its popularity soared", "its creator abruptly removed the game from the marketplace", "it became a top seller on both Apple iPhones and smartphones using the Google Android operating system", "The game uses simple graphics", "it only took him a few days to create Flappy Bird", "most Vietnamese gamers play foreign games, particularly from China"], "when": ["Until Sunday", "Last week", "from the 1980s", "in recent days"], "where": ["in Vietnam", "in South-East Asia", "The local market", "the global market"], "why": ["because the attention was overwhelming", "by complicated licensing procedures"], "who": ["Korean popstar Psys", "the editor of Tech-in-Asia, Anh Minh Do", "29-year-old creator, Hanoi native Nguyen Ha Dong", "experts", "VNG", "Tech In Asias Minh", "Do Quy Doan", "deputy minister of communication"], "how": ["players guide a flapping bird between broken pipes", "by tapping the screen"], "product_name": ["Flappy Bird", "Super Mario Brothers"], "countermeasures": ["hiring teams of programmers", "copy the principles of Flappy Bird"], "new_features": ["simple but frustratingly difficult video game", "infuriatingly addictive", "simple graphics"], "effects": ["he was taking the game down", "it also ruins my simple life", "I hate it, he wrote", "success of Flappy Bird is very encouraging for the future of the games industry", "the spotlight is likely to remain on Flappy Birds creator"]}}
{"text": "HANOIXDespite what many players of his infuriatingly difficult \"Flappy Bird\" smartphone game seem to think, Dong Nguyen isn't actually Satan. \"I just wanted to create a game that people could enjoy for a few minutes,\" he said Tuesday in a wide-ranging interview. His game, which became a global phenomenon, in recent weeks soared to the top of the charts in Apple Inc. AAPL +0.27%  's App Store and Google Inc.'s Play, turning the shy 29-year-old Mr. Dong into something of a sensation among small, independent game developers. His notoriety grew further when he mysteriously withdrew the free game from circulation Sunday at the height of its success. \"It was just too addictive,\" Mr. Dong said. He said he didn't intend for people to play the game for hours at a time, as many gamers appear to have done. \"That was the main negative. So I decided to take it down,\" he said. \"Flappy Bird\" has delighted and enraged players in equal measure. To progress through the game, players tap the screens of their phones to keep a crude, heavily pixilated bird aloft and navigate a mazelike series of obstacles. On the face of it, the game couldn't be simpler. But \"Flappy Bird\" is also extraordinarily difficult. Many players have posted screenshots of their high scores to Twitter TWTR -1.27%  or other social media sites to show how they are getting on. The goalkeeper for English soccer club Arsenal recently posted his record score for the game shortly after rival Liverpool fired five goals past him. \"Game over!\" Wojciech Szczesny wrote on Facebook FB -0.33%  after racking up an impressive personal best of 282 points. For comparison, Mr. Dong said his best score is 150. Other players wrote unusually extensive reviews of the game on Apple's App Store, detailing the misery they say Mr. Dong's creation inflicted. \"I would, in a heartbeat, sell my soul to Satan just to have never downloaded this app,\" one reviewer wrote. It is the game many people love to hate, though. Some players have jokingly suggested that Mr. Dong himself might be the devil, and his decision to take down the game from the store was greeted with both applause and mourning. In a bizarre tribute, some players listed their iPhones for sale on Internet auction site eBay, EBAY +1.99%  noting that they were preloaded with \"Flappy Bird.\" One was listed for $134,295, although others are more modestly priced, with \"Flappy Bird\" mentioned as an additional inducement to potential buyers. Some gaming industry observers were stunned that Mr. Dong would voluntarily kill off a game that at its peak was bringing in $50,000 a day in advertising revenue. (However, the app continues to display ads to the millions of people that have downloaded it and keep playing.) Speculation in recent days has been rife that removing the game was a publicity stunt to drum up interest in future games he is working on. The reality, Mr. Dong said, is that he enjoys making videogames in his spare time, and the attention that \"Flappy Bird\" garnered badly crimped his style. He still lives at home with his parents in Hanoi, but finds it difficult to walk down the street in his neighborhood without being pestered. He said he has virtually disconnected himself from the Internet and hasn't checked his email in days. He is also on vacation from his day job writing firmware for sophisticated computer hardware and said he isn't sure if or when he will return to work. The fuss, Mr. Dong said, \"is extremely uncomfortable\" and he is waiting for his life to return to normal. He refused to be photographed or filmed for this article. \"I would, in a heartbeat, sell my soul to Satan just to have never downloaded this app.\"\nThe spread of the Internet, and especially the mobile Web, increases the odds of surprise hits such as \"Flappy Bird\" emerging from seemingly nowhere, industry analysts say. The growing ubiquity of smartphones, in particular, is breaking the tether between gamers and expensive consoles, enabling virtual unknowns such as Mr. Dong to go viral like Internet video clips. Rovio Entertainment Ltd., for instance, was a comparatively small-time developer in Finland before it came up with \"Angry Birds\" for the iPhone in 2009. Vietnam, meanwhile, has quietly developed its own games culture among its narrow, higgledy-piggledy townhouses and coffee shops. In 2012, Hanoi-based Emobi Games developed a shoot 'em-up-style game based on the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, in which revolutionary leader Ho Chi Minh routed French colonial forces in 1954. VNG Corp. has developed a series of martial-arts combat games of the kind most frequently played online in Internet cafes. Mr. Dong said he spent three days developing \"Flappy Bird.\" It employs a distinctive retro style that the young Vietnamese said he thinks is simple and compelling. \"It is pure. It is all about the game, not about the ornamentation or decoration,\" he said. His style is in contrast to the increasingly complex games now proliferating on mobile devices offering in-app purchases to help players buy their way to the next level of difficulty. That could be part of its appeal. \"It is a throwback to the games many of us grew up with,\" said Vietnam-based technology writer Anh-Minh Do. \"But what a lot of people have ignored is the discipline of 'Flappy Bird''s game design. They underestimate his smarts in making it as hard as it is. Yes, he's been lucky. But that's not the full picture.\" \"Flappy Bird\" initially had a quiet start to life, launching in May last year to relatively little attention. Mr. Dong didn't bother trying to promote it. But in January Swedish gamer Felix Kjellberg Xbetter known as YouTube star PewDiePieXfeatured it in a rundown of his favorite games. The video has since been watched 9.8 million times, and helped to propel \"Flappy Bird\" to the top of the app charts. Since pulling it from Apple's and Google's app stores, interest in Mr. Dong's other games, including \"Ninjas Assault\" and \"Droplet Shuffle,\" has increased. Mr. Dong said he is working on three prototypes in a similar vein to \"Flappy Bird.\" If there is one positive to be gleaned from the furor over his most famous creation, it is that \"I have more freedom and confidence to create more games,\" he said. Meanwhile, \"Flappy Bird\" has flown the coop and found a new lease on life since Mr. Dong pulled it from the app stores. It is available at various online sites, albeit not in its original, hand-held habitat. The game has also spawned several knockoffs, with names like \"Clumsy Bird,\" \"Splashy Fish\" and \"Flappy Bee,\" that were among the most popular free apps in Apple's and Google's app stores on Tuesday. If there is a lesson the rest of the world can learn from its success, Mr. Dong said it is a simple one: \"Just be patient,\" he said.", "label": {"what": ["soared to the top of the charts in Apple Inc.

{"text": "Flappy Bird flaps no more. The Vietnamese developer behind the smash-hit free game has pulled his creation from online app stores after announcing that its runaway success had ruined his simple life\". The addictive and notoriously difficult game skyrocketed to popularity after its initial release last May to become the number one downloaded mobile app for both Apple and Android phones. Despite this success, Flappy Bird's creator, 29-year-old Dong Nguyen, announced on his Twitter February 8 that he would be deleting the game from both the Apple iOS and Google Play stores. I am sorry 'Flappy Bird' users, 22 hours from now, I will take 'Flappy Bird' down. I cannot take this anymore.\n\nX Dong Nguyen (@dongatory) February 8, 2014 It is not anything related to legal issues. I just cannot keep it anymore.\n\nX Dong Nguyen (@dongatory) February 8, 2014 Currently, the game is unlisted on app stores. A computer version of Flappy Bird still remains online, and users who have already downloaded the game onto their mobile devices can continue to play it. Nguyen's decision to remove his brainchild from app stores immediately drew ire from particularly rabid fans. Within a matter of hours after his initial announcement, the developer received an onslaught of expletive-filled spam, including numerous death threats. Programmed by Nguyen in a matter of days, Flappy Bird featured a pixelated bird that had to be piloted past a series of pipes. With a frustratingly high difficulty level and finnicky controls, the game gained international popularity in January through word-of-mouth, largely by fans who harshly criticised it but kept playing in hopes of achieving higher scores. Eventually, Flappy Bird became the number one iOS app in more than 100 countries, and in an interview with The Verge, Nguyen revealed that his creation was making him as much as US$50,000 (HK$390,000) in revenue per day from online advertising banners. Criticism of the game followed its fame, and some analysts speculated that Nguyen had used automated programs - also known as \"bots\" - to inflate Flappy Bird's app store ranking. Others accused nguyen of stealing graphical assets, arguing that both the game's titular bird and its green pipes strongly resembled enemy characters and environments from Nintendo's popular Super Mario Bros series. Nguyen responded to these criticisms on Twitter by arguing that the game's popularity \"could just be luck\" and added that while he had been inspired by the graphics of Super Mario Bros, he had not \"directly stolen [any]thing.\" Nevertheless, the developer also tweeted that the media storm had caused him significant stress. Flappy Bird is a success of mine. But it also ruins my simple life. So now I hate it, Nguyen wrote. In the wake of Flappy Bird's sudden removal from app stores, unverified rumours have swirled that Nguyen may have been legally pressured by Nintendo. \"All of this is just pure rumour. Some say Nintendo [forced him to take the game down], but I don't believe it,\" said An Minh Do, editor of technology blog Tech in Asia. \"[Withdrawing the game] may be a PR stunt or may be due to legal pressure or maybe he's sick of the press.\" Members of the popular internet message board Reddit largely agreed that Flappy Bird's fame had simply been too much for Nguyen to handle. \"He's an indie [developer] living in Vietnam,\" wrote one user named \"uint\" who had previously lived in the country. \"Maybe he's comfortable quitting now that he's had a successful product that's earned him more money than 50 per cent of the country makes in a year combined... Or [maybe] its attracted him some very ugly attention from some very bad people and he wants to drop out of the public spotlight.\" Another forum member named \"sndzag1\" wrote that the game's vocal fanbase had likely contributed to its downfall. \"I'm a game developer, and I can tell you this is extremely common. There are people who sit around on...forums for a disproportionate amount of time, constantly complaining and telling other users how bad [a] game is or how much they dislike it. No constructive criticism, no valuable feedback - they purely exist to whine about things and trash-talk to the game or the developers.\" Whatever the reason for Flappy Bird's fall from grace, one thing is certain - for a brief period of time, Vietnam's tiny but dedicated video game development scene received an unprecendeted amount of attention, all from a little game about a bird crashing into pipes.

{"text": "The developer of Flappy Bird, the former most popular free mobile game on the Apple Inc App Store and Google Inc's Android Play store, took the game down at midnight on Sunday as he announced he would do 22 hours earlier. The game is no longer available to download for either Apple or Google users, but its fans still can have fun with the bird if they already downloaded the game to their devices. Nguyen Ha Dong, a Hanoi-based game developer, announced the grounding of the addictive game in a Tweet at 1900 GMT on Saturday in which he also apologised to Flappy Bird players. \"Twenty-two hours from now, I will take 'Flappy Bird' down,\" Dong said, adding \"it is not anything related to legal issues. \"I cannot take this anymore,\" he wrote. His Tweet attracted more than 136,000 Retweets as of 0430 GMT on Monday. Flappy Bird caused a sensation after rising from obscurity to become one of the most downloaded mobile games on both Apple and Google's online stores. Users have to steer a bird between green pipes. The Android version has been downloaded up to 50 million times and attracted more than half a million reviews. Many people have been questioning Dong on Twitter about his decision to take down the game as only a day earlier he had been talking about developing the game for Microsoft's Windows phones. Dong could not be reached for comment. He turned his telephone off after cancelling an interview with Reuters on Thursday and not finalising arrangements for one on Friday. Unlike other successful game makers like Rovio Entertainment, which produced the hugely popular Angry Birds game and has hundreds of programmers, Dong made Flappy Bird by himself in a few nights, he said on Twitter earlier. The game, which he said was inspired by Nintendo's Mario Bros, has been earning on average $50,000 a day from advertising, Dong said in a media interview. Two friends of Dong said Nintendo had sent him a warning letter, but the Japanese game maker said it was not considering a lawsuit. \"It sounds very much like a rumour and if it is, we certainly can't comment on that,\" Nintendo's media representative told Reuters on Friday. One gaming company manager said Dong's decision to take down the game was wise. \"Dong is taking one step back to avoid legal risk because it's too difficult to deal with legal issues himself if it happens,\" said Duy Doan, a senior manager at VTC Online, one of Vietnam's leading game companies. Dong said earlier that he was not looking for any investors and would not sell the game. One expert said investors would not be interested. \"Flappy Bird is not to the taste of many game investors because it's just hit-based which will bring very uncertain cash flow and no recurring,\" said Nguyen Hieu Linh, investment manager at the Japanese CyberAgent Ventures Inc. \"I doubt he needs to fund raise as he's already earned a certain amount of money and he doesn't need more help to make this kind of mini game,\" Linh added.", "label": {"what": ["took the game down", "announced the grounding of the addictive game", "he also apologised to Flappy Bird players", "His Tweet attracted more than 136,000 Retweets", "Flappy Bird caused a sensation", "rising from obscurity to become one of the most downloaded mobile games", "The Android version has been downloaded up to 50 million times", "attracted more than half a million reviews", "Many people have been questioning Dong on Twitter about his decision to take down the game", "He turned his telephone off", "cancelling an interview with Reuters on Thursday and not finalising arrangements for one on Friday", "Dong made Flappy Bird by himself in a few nights", "has been earning on average $50,000 a day from advertising", "Two friends of Dong said Nintendo had sent him a warning letter", "he was not looking for any investors and would not sell the game"], "when": ["at midnight on Sunday", "22 hours earlier", "at 1900 GMT on Saturday", "Twenty-two hours from now", "0430 GMT on Monday", "on Friday"], "where": ["on the Apple Inc App Store", "Google Inc's Android Play store", "in a Tweet", "in a media interview"], "why": ["as only a day earlier he had been talking about developing the game for Microsoft's Windows phones", "because it's too difficult to deal with legal issues himself if it happens", "because it's just hit-based which will bring very uncertain cash flow and no recurring", "as he's already earned a certain amount of money"], "who": ["The developer of Flappy Bird", "Apple or Google users", "its fans", "Nguyen Ha Dong", "a Hanoi-based game developer", "successful game makers", "Rovio Entertainment", "hundreds of programmers", "the Japanese game maker", "Nintendo's media representative", "Reuters", "Duy Doan, a senior manager at VTC Online, one of Vietnam's leading game companies", "One expert", "Nguyen Hieu Linh, investment manager at the Japanese CyberAgent Ventures Inc."], "how": ["downloaded the game to their devices", "Users have to steer a bird between green pipes", "Dong made Flappy Bird by himself"], "product_name": ["Angry Birds", "Flappy Bird"], "countermeasures": ["take 'Flappy Bird' down", "adding 'it is not anything related to legal issues"], "new_features": ["popular free mobile game", "inspired by Nintendo's Mario Bros"], "effects": ["the addictive game", "I cannot take this anymore"]}}
{"text": "An investigation is under way after a baby being treated in intensive care died from blood poisoning through an infection caught from a suspected contaminated drip. Public Health England (PHE) said it is examining 14 other cases of septicaemia in babies at a total of six hospitals in England. The infant who died was being treated at St Thomas' Hospital in central London. The baby died on June 1, and the other two children who fell ill at the same neonatal unit are \"responding well\" to antibiotics, a spokeswoman for the hospital said. \"All babies on the unit are being screened for the bacterium as a precaution and enhanced infection control measures have been put in place to prevent any further cases,\" she said. PHE said the 15 cases have been \"strongly linked\" with a number of batches of a liquid called parenteral nutrition, which was fed to the babies through intravenous drips. As well as St Thomas' Hospital, babies have fallen ill in neonatal intensive care units at Chelsea and Westminster NHS Trust (four cases), Whittington Hospital (one case), Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust (three cases), CUH Addenbrookes (two cases) and Luton and Dunstable University Hospital (two cases). Professor Mike Catchpole, PHE's incident director, said: \"We have acted quickly to investigate this issue ... and we have taken action to ensure that the affected batches and any remaining stock of this medicine is not being used in hospitals.\" Parenteral nutrition is usually produced under sterilised conditions to cut the risk that the product could result in infections. Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) issued a Class 1 Drug Alert over the suspected batch of contaminated liquid.

{"text": "A total of 15 babies in six hospitals across England have developed septicaemia after being infected by hospital drip One baby has died and 14 others are fighting for their lives after being poisoned in NHS neonatal care units. A public health alert was issued by health chiefs on Wednesday evening after it emerged that all the newborns infections were caused by a contaminated batch of nutrition drip. The children were affected at neonatal intensive care units at six different hospitals, but the infected nutrition is believed to have been used in 22 hospitals across the country. Officials said that one newborn baby has died while 14 more remain ill with blood poisoning, but were responding to antibiotics. Medical regulators are investigating an incident which occured last Thursday at a London manufacturing plant owned by ITH Pharma Ltd, affecting the liquid feed produced that day. The contamination is believed to have been accidental rather than any act of sabotage. Regulators said because the blood poisoning, caused by a common bacterium known as Bacillus cereus, develops quickly they were not anticipating further cases, although this could not be ruled out. The 15 babies were being treated in six neonatal intensive care units and many had been born prematurely. The newborn died on Sunday at Guys and St Thomas Hospital, which is treating two other cases. Adam Finn, professor of paediatrics, University of Bristol, said: When a medicine makes patients sick, it is everyones worst nightmare. \"This contamination incident seems to have been detected quickly but, tragically, not quickly enough to save a life lost. Having stopped the outbreak, the next priority will be to understand how it came to happen and ensure it cannot recur. The newborns, most of whom were premature, were being fed through a tube into their bloodstream because they were too poorly to be mouth fed. Public Health England (PHE) and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) have launched an investigation. All neonatal intensive care units in the country have been informed and a recall has been issued for any remaining batches of the liquid feed. The first case appeared at Chelsea and Westminster hospital on Saturday and then other London hospitals began to see cases over the weekend. It was thought to have been caused by infected bedding or similar products used locally until cases began appearing elsewhere on Monday and Tuesday. The final cases at Luton were diagnosed early on Wednesday and investigations soon identified the feed as the likely cause, a spokesman for Public Health England said. An incident at the manufacturing plant is thought to have been the source of accidental contamination and inspectors will visit the plant run by ITH Pharma Ltd. The company, based in London, was founded by Adam Bloom and Karen Hamling, both trained pharmacists. Late on Wednesday Ms Hamling issued a statement through lawyers saying ITH Pharma was \"very saddened to hear about the death of a baby in hospital, and that 14 others are ill with septicaemia\". \"ITH Pharma is a specialist manufacturer of parenteral nutrition, which is given to babies in neo-natal intensive care units. The products in question, which are no longer in circulation, are made to order for individual patients on a daily basis, in response to bespoke orders from hospitals. \"We are co-operating fully with the MHRA in the investigation, and are doing everything we can to help them establish the facts in this case as quickly as possible.\" Bacillus cereus is a bacteria found widely in the environment in dust, soil and vegetation. Most surfaces would be likely to test positive for its presence. Adam Burgess, the MHRAs manager of the Defective Medicines Reporting Centre, said: We have sent inspectors to the manufacturers facility to carry out a detailed and rigorous inspection and we have ensured that the potentially affected medicine is recalled. Dr Susan Hill, a consultant paediatric gastroenterologist said: This is a life-saving treatment for babies who are born very prematurely or with a severe gut problem. Any challenge to their immune system can be life-threatening. A spokesman for Guys and St Thomass Trust said: All babies on the unit are being screened for the bacterium as a precaution and enhanced infection control measures have been put in place to prevent any further cases.

{"text": "A nine-day-old baby died after he was poisoned by the hospital feed drip that was supposed to help save his life Yousef Al-Kharboush contracted a deadly bacterial infection from contaminated intravenous fluid on the neonatal intensive care unit at St Thomas Hospital in London. The number of vulnerable babies made ill by the rogue batch of drips has risen to 18, with babies at nine hospitals throughout the country affected. The surviving babies are understood to be responding to treatment with antibiotics. It emerged yesterday that the contaminated products supplied by London-based pharmaceutical firm ITH Pharma had been sent to a total of 22 hospitals. Public health officials are conducting a major investigation into the devastating outbreak. ITH Pharma said there was no reason for patients or their families to be concerned because the limited number of batches that could have been affected had been recalled. Southwark coroner Andrew Harris is treating Yousefs death on Sunday as unnatural. He will today hold a special pre-inquest hearing with the babys parents, Guys and St Thomas NHS Trust and ITH Pharma to decide whether a post-mortem examination is needed and what further steps he should take. One new case was confirmed yesterday at Peterborough City Hospital in Cambridgeshire and two possible cases found at Southend University Hospital and Basildon University Hospital, both in Essex. The source of contamination appears to have been traced to a sourced single raw material ingredient'from an outside supplier, according to ITH Pharma. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has launched an investigation and sent its inspectors into ITH Pharmas plant in Park Royal, north-west London. A spokesman for the safety watchdog said a possible sanction would be a temporary suspension of the manufacturers licence if the problem had not been remedied. A decision is expected in the next few days. ITH Pharma managing director Karen Hamling, 48, who runs the company with her husband Adam Bloom, 41, said yesterday: As a mother, as a pharmacist, as someone who has worked for 30 years in healthcare, inside and outside the NHS, I am deeply saddened that one baby has died and others have fallen ill from septicaemia. 'As the managing director of ITH Pharma, I want to reassure you today that we are doing everything possible to help the regulators, the MHRA, to establish exactly what has happened in this case. 'We have instituted a recall of the limited number of batches which could potentially have been affected, and all stock has been removed from circulation. 'Given this action, there is no reason for patients, their families or healthcare professionals to be concerned.' But a lawyer specialising in medical products yesterday called for all liquid feed products made by ITH Pharma to be taken out of circulation until the reasons for the outbreak had been established. Michelle Victor, a partner in the product liability team at Leigh Day, said: While the investigation takes place these products should be withdrawn as the risks are too great. Chris Thorne, an expert on clinical negligence at Clarke Willmott solicitors, said the families involved may have grounds for a civil action. He said: 'The simplistic approach would be to pursue the organisation which supplied the food if it is formally identified as the source of the bacterium which caused the illness.' Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, said yesterday there was 'a lot further to go in ensuring patient safety. The tragic blood poisoning of 18 children shows we can never take safety for granted. It also shows the importance of prompt and early identification of problems,' he added. In total, 160 units of the suspected contaminated batch of feed were sent to 22 hospitals. It was sent to ten hospitals across London C Chelsea and Westminster, Hillingdon, the Harley Street Clinic, Homerton, Kings College, the Portland, Royal Brompton, St Thomas, St Georges and the Whittington C and four in East Anglia: Addenbrookes in Cambridge, Basildon, Peterborough and Southend. Two affected hospitals in the West Midlands are Birmingham Heartlands and Russells Hall in Dudley, and the suspect batch was also sent to Lister Hospital in Stevenage, Luton and Dunstable Hospital, Chertseys Royal Sussex County and St Peters hospitals, Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire and Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool. Two children were given fluid from the contaminated batch at St Georges Hospital, London, and 16 at Alder Hey, without ill effects. None were newborns. Bacillus cereus is a bacterium found in dust, soil and vegetation. It produces very hardy spores which in the right conditions can grow and create a toxin which causes illness, and it is likely to be on most surfaces. Stephen Forsythe, professor of microbiology at Nottingham Trent University, said: The babies would have virtually no immune system to protect them. 'This seems like a totally exceptional and unusual incident. However, unfortunately it has already had a tragic ending.'", "label": {"what": ["A nine-day-old baby died", "The surviving babies are understood to be responding to treatment", "One new case was confirmed", "two possible cases found", "The tragic blood poisoning of 18 children", "160 units of the suspected contaminated batch of feed were sent to 22 hospitals", "Two children were given fluid from the contaminated batch and16 at Alder Hey", "it has already had a tragic ending", "a totally exceptional and unusual incident"], "when": ["yesterday", "on Sunday", "in the next few days"], "where": ["at St Thomas Hospital", "in London", "on the neonatal intensive care unit", "at nine hospitals", "at Peterborough City Hospital", "in Cambridgeshire", "at Southend University Hospital", "Basildon University Hospital", "in Essex", "in Park Royal, north-west London", "at Clarke Willmott solicitors", "at Leigh Day", "C Chelsea and Westminster", "Hillingdon", "Harley Street Clinic", "Homerton, Kings College", "the Portland", "Royal Brompton", "St Thomas", "St Georges and the Whittington C", "Addenbrookes in Cambridge", "Basildon", "Peterborough and Southend", "Birmingham Hospital", "Chertseys Royal Sussex County", "St Peters hospitals", "Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire", "Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool", "at St Georges Hospital, London"], "why": ["he was poisoned by the hospital feed drip", "contaminated intravenous fluid", "the contaminated products supplied by London-based pharmaceutical firm ITH Pharma had been sent to a total of 22 hospitals", "devastating outbreak", "None were newborns", "It produces very hardy spores", "create a toxin which causes illness", "The babies would have virtually no immune system"], "who": ["A nine-day-old baby", "Yousef Al-Kharboush", "vulnerable babies", "The surviving babies", "contaminated products", "ITH Pharma", "Public health officials", "Southwark coroner Andrew Harris", "the babys parents, Guys and St Thomas NHS Trust", "The source of contamination", "The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)", "A spokesman for the safety watchdog", "ITH Pharma managing director Karen Hamling", "Adam Bloom", "the MHRA", "patients, their families", "healthcare professionals", "a lawyer specialising in medical products", "Michelle Victor, a partner in the product liability team", "Chris Thorne", "Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt", "Two children", "Bacillus cereus", "Stephen Forsythe, professor of microbiology at Nottingham Trent University", "The babies"], "how": ["Yousef Al-Kharboush contracted a deadly bacterial infection", "The number of vulnerable babies made ill by the rogue batch of drips has risen to 18", "babies at nine hospitals throughout the country affected", "one baby has died and others have fallen ill from septicaemia", "without ill effects"], "countermeasures": ["treatment with antibiotics", "Public health officials are conducting a major investigation", "the limited number of batches that could have been affected had been recalled", "hold a special pre-inquest hearing", "a post-mortem examination", "launched an investigation and sent its inspectors into ITH Pharmas plant", "a possible sanction would be a temporary suspension of the manufacturers licence", "a recall of the limited number of batches which could potentially have been affected", "all stock has been removed from circulation", "all liquid feed products made by ITH Pharma to be taken out of circulation", "these products should be withdrawn"]}}
{"text": "A newborn baby has died and 14 others are suffering from blood poisoning after they were infected by a contaminated batch of liquid food distributed to intensive care units across London and the south-east of England. The babies were in neonatal intensive care units in six separate hospitals because they were premature, poorly and vulnerable and too frail to be fed by mouth. The liquid food was being administered by drips. The units had all received supplies from the same batch of liquid feed from a specialist company based in north-west London, ITH Pharma Limited. The emergency developed rapidly over the weekend with one baby after another falling ill, triggering a frantic search to identify the source of the bacteria causing the life-threatening septicaemia. The 14 babies that survived were responding to antibiotics but still poorly, said Public Health England (PHE), and had underlying problems that made them even more vulnerable. The first case occurred in Chelsea and Westminster hospital on Friday and was reported to PHE on Saturday, when staff failed to find a reason for the symptoms, which resembled very severe food poisoning. Over the weekend the hospital identified further cases. By Monday babies with septicaemia were being reported by Guy's and St Thomas' NHS trust where one of the babies subsequently died. In total there have been four cases at Chelsea and Westminster, three at Guy's and St Thomas' and another baby became ill at the Whittington hospital, also in London. Experts thought the problem could be restricted to London until Brighton and Sussex University hospitals trust reported three cases, Addenbrookes in Cambridge two cases, and Luton and Dunstable University hospital two more. It was not until the early hours of Wednesday morning that the contaminated batch of liquid feed was identified as the problem. \"Initially they were looking at the environment C at the taps and the laundry,\" a PHE spokeswoman said. But with no clues from the physical environment, attention turned to the parenteral nutrition (intravenous feeding). \"Doctors were asked what feed they had used,\" said the spokeswoman, identifying the potential source. The neonatal units had all received supplies from the same batch of liquid feed supplied by the specialist company ITH Pharma Limited. Investigators from the MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority) contacted company staff early yesterday. Discussions with the staff established that an incident had taken place at the factory which could have led to contamination with a bacterium known as Bacillus cereus, which is safely carried on the skin but can cause food poisoning if it enters the gut or septicaemia if it enters the blood stream. \"This is a very unfortunate incident and PHE have been working closely with the MHRA to investigate how these babies could have become infected,\" said Professor Mike Catchpole, in charge of the incident at PHE. \"Given that the bacteria is widely spread in the environment we are continuing to investigate any other potential sources of infection. However all our investigations to date indicate that the likely source of the infection has been identified. We have acted quickly to investigate this issue alongside the MHRA and we have taken action to ensure that the affected batches and any remaining stock of this medicine is not being used in hospitals.\" The feed has only a seven-day life and the batch expired on 2 June. Experts from the MHRA are now inspecting the plant where the feed was manufactured to try to establish exactly what happened. \"All three babies affected have responded to treatment and are progressing well,\" said Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS trust. \"We have spoken with the parents of the three babies and have prepared a briefing note for all other parents of babies on the unit.\" Late on Wednesday ITH Pharma issued a statement through lawyers saying it was \"very saddened to hear about the death of a baby in hospital, and that 14 others are ill with septicaemia\". \"ITH Pharma is a specialist manufacturer of parenteral nutrition, which is given to babies in neo-natal intensive care units. The products in question, which are no longer in circulation, are made to order for individual patients on a daily basis, in response to bespoke orders from hospitals. \"We are co-operating fully with the MHRA in the investigation, and are doing everything we can to help them establish the facts in this case as quickly as possible.\" Chelsea and Westminster NHS trust said all four babies affected there were responding to treatment. \"Every baby on the unit has been screened for this bacterium as a precaution and even more stringent infection control measures have been put in place. Initially admissions to the unit were restricted but we are now returning to full operational capacity,\" it said in a statement. \"The Trust took immediate action and were the first to inform Public Health England as soon as the problem was identified and we continue to work closely with them to investigate this issue.\" Dr Jennifer Birch, clinical director for neonatal intensive care at Luton and Dunstable University hospital, said: \"We are informing all the parents whose babies are being cared for in our neonatal intensive care unit about this situation.

{"text": "Senior health officials warned there may be more babies infected by the contaminated drip, which has been linked to the death of one infant and illness of 14 others. Paul Cosford, director for health protection at Public Health England, said the liquid feed was by far the most likely cause of the infection and had been sent to 22 hospitals. The health regulator has alerted every hospital across the country to ensure any further cases are quickly reported, Mr Cosford revealed. \"We have notified every hospital across the country so that if there are any cases we are not aware of, we will find out about them quickly,\" he said. His colleague Deborah Turbitt, who oversees health protection in London, said: \"We think we know all of the babies who have been affected at the moment. \"It is just possible that one or two babies have been infected and have been treated who have not been notified to us.\" A public health alert was issued by health chiefs on Wednesday evening after it emerged all the newborns had been given a nutrition drip manufactured by London-based ITH Pharma Ltd. Medical regulators are investigating an incident which occurred last Thursday at the companys London manufacturing plant. The contamination is believed to have been accidental rather than any act of sabotage. Speaking to BBC Radio 4s Today programme, Mr Cosford said: This looks as if it is the most likely cause of these infections. There's two reasons for that. \"One is that the manufacturer, with the regulator, has looked back at the process and identified a possible point in the manufacturing process where infection may have entered towards the end of last week. \"The second point is that all the cases of this infection that we have so far, the dates of onset of that infection would fit with them having been the recipient of this particular feed that may have been contaminated.\" All of the feeds which could be contaminated have since been recalled and regulators stressed that it was unlikely any were still in use as the batch has passed its use-by date. \"We know there are 22 hospitals across the country which received this product,\" he said. \"We also know that that product is no longer being used, it's a very short-life product. The regulator has put out an urgent recall to make sure that there isn't any of it being used.\" Paediatric doctors on Wednesday said the contamination was every parents worst nightmare and that urgent action must be taken to improve the safety of processes to produce such nutrition. The blood poisoning, caused by a common bacterium known as Bacillus cereus, develops quickly so any as yet undetected cases are expected emerge very soon. The 15 babies were being treated in six neonatal intensive care units and many had been born prematurely. The newborn died on Sunday at Guys and St Thomas Hospital, which is treating two other cases. Adam Finn, professor of paediatrics, University of Bristol, said: When a medicine makes patients sick, it is everyones worst nightmare. \"This contamination incident seems to have been detected quickly but, tragically, not quickly enough to save a life lost. Having stopped the outbreak, the next priority will be to understand how it came to happen and ensure it cannot recur. The newborns, most of whom were premature, were being fed through a tube into their bloodstream because they were too poorly to be mouth fed. Public Health England (PHE) and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) are investigating. The first case appeared at Chelsea and Westminster hospital on Saturday and then other London hospitals began to see cases over the weekend. It was thought to have been caused by infected bedding or similar products used locally until cases began appearing elsewhere on Monday and Tuesday. The final cases at Luton were diagnosed early on Wednesday and investigations soon identified the feed as the likely cause, a spokesman for Public Health England said. An incident at the manufacturing plant is thought to have been the source of accidental contamination and inspectors will visit the plant run by ITH Pharma Ltd. The company, based in London, was founded by Adam Bloom and Karen Hamling, both trained pharmacists. Late on Wednesday Ms Hamling issued a statement through lawyers saying ITH Pharma was \"very saddened to hear about the death of a baby in hospital, and that 14 others are ill with septicaemia\". \"ITH Pharma is a specialist manufacturer of parenteral nutrition, which is given to babies in neo-natal intensive care units.

A public health alert was issued by health chiefs yesterday evening (June 4) after it emerged that all infections were caused by a drip used in neonatal intensive care units in six separate hospitals. The units had all received supplies from the same batch of liquid feed from a specialist company based in north-west London, ITH Pharma Limited. Public Health England (PHE) and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) have launched an investigation into an incident which occured last Thursday (May 29) at a London manufacturing plant owned by ITH Pharma Ltd affecting the liquid feed produced that day. The contamination is believed to have been accidental rather than any act of sabotage. All neo-natal units in the UK have been alerted to the threat, and the contaminated product has been withdrawn. In a statement, ITH Pharma's managing director, Karen Hamling, said: \"The products in question, which are no longer in circulation, are made to order for individual patients on a daily basis, in response to bespoke orders from hospitals. The London-based company - founded by Adam Bloom and Karen Hamling, both trained pharmacists - is a specialist manufacturer of food given to babies through intravenous drips in intensive care units. Yesterday, paediatric doctors said the contamination was every parents worst nightmare and that urgent action must be taken to improve the safety of processes to produce such nutrition. Regulators said because the blood poisoning, caused by a common bacterium known as Bacillus cereus, develops quickly they were not anticipating further cases, although this could not be ruled out. Bacillus cereus is a bacteria found widely in the environment in dust, soil and vegetation. Most surfaces would be likely to test positive for its presence. Adam Finn, professor of paediatrics, University of Bristol, said: When a medicine makes patients sick, it is everyones worst nightmare. \"This contamination incident seems to have been detected quickly but, tragically, not quickly enough to save a life lost.

ITH Pharma managing director Karen Hamling said it was co-operating fully with an inquiry by health officials. The baby died from blood poisoning at St Thomas' Hospital in south London from suspected contaminated drip food. Public Health England said babies at six hospitals developed septicaemia from the Bacillus cereus bacterium. 'Establish facts' Ms Hamling said in a statement: \"ITH Pharma is very saddened to hear about the death of a baby in hospital, and that 17 others are ill with septicaemia. \"The products in question, which are no longer in circulation, are made to order for individual patients on a daily basis, in response to bespoke orders from hospitals. \"We are co-operating fully with the MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) in the investigation, and are doing everything we can to help them establish the facts in this case as quickly as possible.\" Public Health England (PHE) said the cases were \"strongly linked\" with a number of batches of a particular form of the intravenous liquid made by the London-based company.

The prime minister was speaking to an audience of 300 experts who have pledged to find a cure by 2025. He wants a team of experts to report back to him by October on how drugs companies can be encouraged to develop new dementia medicines In his speech, the prime minister told experts that dementia is one of the \"greatest enemies of humanity\". \"We are renewing our commitment to say by 2025 we want to find a cure to dementia. We should treat this as a disease rather than as some natural part of ageing,\" he said. He said there was a need to develop more drugs and get them to patients more quickly. For that to happen, international collaboration and more money for dementia research was needed, he said. Speaking to an audience of global dementia and finance specialists, David Cameron said he would speed up progress on dementia drugs by getting experts to come up with new proposals on areas such as drug patent extensions, by October. He added: \"Something like 50m a year is being spent on dementia research, rather than the 590m spent on cancer. It is important to see dementia as a disease and one that we need to better understand so that we can tackle it.\" Mr Cameron told BBC Radio 4's You And Yours that more needs to be done to improve the lives of those with dementia. \"So much of this is about making sure hospitals and care homes treat people with dementia better and, absolutely crucially, that we build dementia-friendly communities where all of us try and understand better what it's like to live with dementia,\" he said.

The new study will collect the medical and lifestyle data of two million volunteers in Britain aged over 50, using cognitive studies, brain imaging and genetics to shed light on causes and possible treatments for dementia, the most common form of which is Alzheimer's disease. The information collected is expected to help scientists identify those most at risk of developing dementia and pinpoint causes and risk factors for disease. \"We need to join up the dots and create a big, bold global push to beat this,\" Cameron said, saying that regulations should be eased to allow new drugs to be tested earlier. \"It will take years of work but we have shown with other diseases that we can make progress and we will do so again.\" Cameron criticised a \"market failure\" that meant global spending on dementia was five times smaller than investment into cancer research, meaning only three drugs had been released to market in 15 years. He called on governments to create incentives for research into dementia, which cost the global economy $604 billion in 2010, according to Alzheimer's Disease International. Britain used its 2013 presidency of the G8 to call an international summit on dementia, at which experts set a goal to find a cure by 2025. The British government is to put forward proposals to extend the length that drug companies can hold patents to incentivise research, and is increasing its funding for dementia research to ?66 million ($113 million, 82 million euros) in 2015, up from ?28 million in 2009.

{"text": "The world's biggest dementia study was launched in the U.K. Thursday, and will analyze data from more than two million people to try and find new treatments for the little-understood disease, including its commonest form, Alzheimer's. The study C a $27 million public-private partnership C forms part of coordinated G8 efforts to target dementia, and will be run by the U.K's publicly-funded Medical Research Council, with support from several drug makers C AstraZeneca AZN.LN -0.66%, GlaxoSmithKline GSK.LN -0.13% and Janssen Research and Development, a unit of Johnson  and  Johnson. The public policy focus is being warmly greeted, given an industry pull-back in the area. Spending on dementia research is five times lower globally than spending on cancer, as U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron points out. Research into drugs targeting the brain and central nervous system makes up just 15% of the industry's projects, estimates Barclays BARC.LN -5.11%. That's despite the diseases' disproportionate cost to national health systems. There are good reasons for this: developing neuroscience drugs is a high risk undertaking. They typically have lower success rates in clinical trials and with regulators, since efficacy can be hard to prove. Physiologically, the actions of the brain and nervous system are not as well understood as, say, the mechanics of the gut. For instance, Bristol-Myers Squibb BMY +2.88% stopped neuroscience drug discovery last November.

{"text": "Patients must be given early access to new dementia drugs as part of a drive to eradicate the illness within 11 years, David Cameron will pledge on Thursday. The Prime Minister will tell the pharmaceutical industry that the current pace of drug development is not good enough and more must be done. Under plans to be unveiled later this year, regulations will be loosened on the testing of new drugs, as happened during the drive to curb the spread of HIV and Aids. That will make it easier for patients with terminal conditions to volunteer for trials of the latest treatments. The plans would help to bring the successful drugs to the market more rapidly, the Prime Minister hopes. The patents on dementia drugs are likely to be extended, making it more profitable for firms to develop and sell them. The British-led drive to spur global research on dementia will help to hold back the onset of the disease by 2025 or could even deliver a cure, Mr Cameron will say. People in their 40s today would then be spared developing the disease. Mr Cameron wants public spending on dementia drug research to double from 66? million in 2015 to 122?million in 2015. He will write to the leaders of other advanced nations urging them to match that commitment. He is also looking for ways to encourage private sector investment in the industry. He will tell the pharmaceutical industry that the status quo is not good enough. Business and governments must accelerate progress on developing new drugs. The World Health Organisation forecasts that the numbers of dementia suffers will double worldwide every two decades. However, global spending on dementia is five times below that spent on cancer due to a market failure in dementia research and drug development. Only three new drugs have been put on the market in the past 15 years. Drugs that delay the onset of dementia by three years would save Britain 5? billion a year in treatment and economic output, ministers believe. Mr Cameron will tell the medical summit today: \"The truth is that dementia now stands alongside cancer as one of the greatest enemies of humanity. \"We have to fight to cure it. I know some people will say that it's not possible, but we have seen with cancer what medicine can achieve. We first need to tackle head-on the market failure perilously undermining dementia research and drug development. \"And we need investment in research, greater collaboration, better incentives for taking new treatments to market and earlier access to innovative new treatments. We need to join up the dots and create a big, bold global push to beat this. It will take years of work but we have shown with other diseases that we can make progress and we will do so again.\" Dr Dennis Gillings, who has been appointed the World Dementia Envoy by the Prime Minister, will tell the summit that progress has been \"achingly slow\" and \"radical change\" is needed.

At least five times more is spent on cancer research than dementia worldwide, and only three new dementia drugs have come on to the market in the last 15 years. Professor Martin Knapp, from the London School of Economics, said discovering a treatment to delay the onset of dementia by just 36 months would save the country as much as 5billion a year. Mr Cameron will claim there is a market failure, with scientists and drug companies having no incentive to prioritise dementia research.

{"text": "The problem with developing treatments for dementia is that it requires an extraordinarily detailed understanding of our most complex organ - the brain. And that has meant far more has been spent on research over the last than has been recouped by marketable therapies. There have been clinical trials on 104 potential drugs in the last 15 years but just three have received regulatory approval. 29 billion has been spent on dementia R and D with very little to show for it. No wonder that for every one scientist researching dementia in the UK, there are six working on cancer. And no wonder David Cameron's Dementia Envoy, Dr Dennis Gillings, says the target to find a cure or an effective treatment by 2025 is \"impossible\" without better incentives for investment, and a loosening of the red tape surrounding clinical trials. But for research to have any real chance of untangling what does cause the many forms of dementia, it has to be a global endeavour. In particular the USA has to recognise funding research into dementia is important. Yet in 2011 the US National Institutes of Health committed less than $500 million to dementia research, compared to more than $6 billion on cancer. David Cameron is writing to Barack Obama and the other G8 leaders urging them to follow his lead. Their backing is badly needed.

{"text": "Dementia now ranks alongside cancer as one of the \"greatest enemies\" of humanity, the Prime Minister has said. David Cameron called on experts from the fields of research and finance to bring \"passion and determination\" to the fight against the condition. Speaking to delegates at a dementia summit in London, Mr Cameron said there has been a \"market failure\" on dementia drug research and development. He set out a series of steps to combat the barriers to drug development including; better collaboration among researchers, quicker access to drugs for patients, encouraging more investment in research and to address the market failure. \"For far too long this terrible condition has been ignored, downplayed or accepted as a natural part of the ageing process,\" Mr Cameron said. \"The truth is, dementia now ranks alongside cancer as one of the greatest enemies of humanity. \"We need to rectify this and fight it with the same determination and passion as we brought to the fight against cancer.\" He added: \"When only three out of 101 dementia drugs developed between 1998 and 2011 came to the market, I think it is clear that incentives for dementia research are not yet right - the risks are too high and the rewards are too low and if anything this problem is set to get more acute.\" The UK will examine whether it can extend patents so drug developers have a longer period of exclusivity after creating a drug, he said. Mr Cameron continued: \"Even when we develop new drugs it can take far too long to get through to patients, this means patients are being denied access to new innovative treatment. \"Of course it's right that any new drug should be thoroughly tested, but what we saw with HIV and Aids in the 1980 is when faced with a terminal condition, some patients are prepared to take a chance on new treatment. \"These are difficult medical judgments but they are questions that should be asked.\" He added that more must be done to encourage collaboration from researchers around the world. \"Innovation can be undermined by a lack of openness and collaboration,\" he said. \"We need to join up the dots and make a big, bold global push to beat this.\" Mr Cameron added that more investment in research needed to be generated. He pledged to write to G7 leaders to encourage them to work together on these challenges and to ask them to bring together the targets in a new global charter. \"We know we are at the beginning of one of the greatest battles in human medicine,\" he added. \"It will take years of patient work and progress at times I am sure will be painfully slow, but we have shown with other diseases that we can, if we launch a global effort, crack these problems.\" Last year, the UK used its presidency of the G8 to host an international summit on dementia, which ended with experts setting a global ambition to find a cure by 2025. Today, delegates came together again for the first in a series of legacy events following the summit and were told by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt that there is a \"desperate need\" for more investment in research. The economic and social reasons to find a cure, or disease-modifying therapy, cannot be ignored, Mr Hunt said. \"The UK Government is doing what we can. Since 2009 we have increased investment in dementia research from 28 million to 52 million and we are on target to increase research spending to 66 million by 2015. \"But globally we desperately need to see new investment flowing into dementia research. \"We know from detailed analysis done by the London School of Economics that there is an impelling case both for economic and social viewpoints. That research shows that if treatment were available to delay the onset of dementia by just 36 months, it would save us here in the region of 5 billion per annum. \"Currently few people understand what it takes to find a treatment and eventually a cure that works and is also safe. We know it is a fiendishly complicated process that is going to take co-ordination, investment, partnerships from across the many sectors and no doubt many failed attempts to get there. \"We need innovation in finance... to enable cutting-edge research as well as identifying and removing barriers that are currently stopping us achieving this.\" Earlier, Alzheimer's Research UK announced a 100 million research campaign and the Medical Research Council (MRC) said it was undertaking the world's biggest study into dementia, involving two million people. The new world dementia envoy, Dennis Gillings, warned earlier that if global leaders do not incentivise businesses to invest in research, the ambition to find a cure by 2025 will not be met. Dr Gillings said: \"Dementia is a ticking bomb costing the global economy 350 billion and yet progress with research is achingly slow. Research must become more attractive to pharmaceuticals so they will invest and innovate. \"Just as the world came together in the fight against HIV/Aids, we need to free up regulation so that we can test ground-breaking new drugs, and examine whether the period for market exclusivity could be extended. \"Without this radical change, we won't make progress in the fight against dementia.\"", "label": {"what": ["Dementia now ranks alongside cancer as one of the greatest enemies of humanity", "Speaking to delegates at a dementia summit in London, Mr Cameron said there has been a market failure on dementia drug research and development", "work together on these challenges and to ask them to bring together the targets in a new global charter"], "when": ["For far too long", "between 1998 and 2011", "in the 1980", "Last year", "by 2025", "by 2015", "by just 36 months"], "where": ["in London", "the G8", "the London School of Economics", "Alzheimer's Research UK", "the Medical Research Council"], "why": ["The truth is, dementia now ranks alongside cancer as one of the greatest enemies of humanity.

Unless researchers successfully find a way to slow down the decline in brain function or prevent the onset of the disease, this number will double every two decades. In a bid to put an end to the disease, which affects about 800,000 individuals in the United Kingdom, UK Prime minister David Cameron is set to announce a drive to develop medicines that would slow down the onset of Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, or find a cure for the chronic disease by 2025. On Thursday, the prime minister will attend a summit of health and finance leaders in London to speak about the implications of dementia and the urgent need to find a treatment for the illness which causes personality disorder, memory problems and impaired reasoning. Cameron wants to double the spending on dementia drug research, which to date, only amounts to one fifth of that allocated for cancer research. He will also urge businesses and governments to accelerate the development of new drugs as the number of individuals with dementia is anticipated to double every twenty years. Despite the continued prevalence of dementia, only three dementia drugs were developed in the last 15 years. Economic implications are also at stake with the development of new drugs. A dementia drug that could delay the onset of the disease by three years could result in an annual savings of 5?billion in Britain. \"The truth is that dementia now stands alongside cancer as one of the greatest enemies of humanity,\" says the Prime Minister, who will be discussing the matter at the upcoming conference. \"We have to fight to cure it.

{"text": "It is now known that Jimmy Savile sexually abused hundreds of children and women at the height of his fame. Investigators believe the late Top of the Pops host preyed on around 500 vulnerable victims as young as two years old at institutions including the BBC's broadcasting studios, 14 hospitals and 20 children's hospitals across England. Since his death in October 2011, a string of official inquiries have been launched into his offending at hospitals, schools and the BBC. Today an independent inquiry found that Savile abused 60 people, including at least 33 patients aged from five to 75, at Leeds general infirmary. Other hospitals have also released the results of their Savile investigations. 31 October 1926: Savile is born in Leeds, the youngest of seven children. 1955: The earliest incident of abuse recorded by the police. It took place in Manchester, where at the time he managed a dance hall. 1960: In one of a handful of example cases given by the police, a 10-year-old boy asked Savile for his autograph outside a hotel. Savile took the boy inside and seriously sexually assaulted him. 1 January 1964: Savile presents the first ever Top of the Pops for the BBC. He had previously been a DJ at Radio Luxembourg in 1958. 1965: Records show abuse started at the BBC, at Leeds general infirmary, where Savile was a long-term volunteer porter, and at Stoke Mandeville hospital, where he also volunteered. 1966: This was the start of what police have identified as Savile's peak period for abuse, which lasted a decade. 1970: Records show Savile started to abuse girls at Duncroft girls' school near Staines, Surrey, where he was a regular visitor. 1972: In another example of Savile's offences listed by police, he is recorded as groping a 12-year-old boy and his two female friends who were attending a recording of Top of the Pops. 1980s: At some point in the decade, a female victim is believed to have told the Metropolitan police she was assaulted in Savile's campervan in a BBC car park. The police file cannot be located and the investigating officer is now dead. 1990: Savile is knighted, also receiving a papal knighthood. April 2000: In a TV documentary presented by Louis Theroux, Savile acknowledges the rumours about him being a paedophile, but denies it. 26 July 2006: Savile co-presents the final Top of the Pops, an occasion that gave rise to one of the allegations made to police. March 2008: Savile begins legal proceedings against a newspaper that linked him to abuse at the Jersey children's home Haut de la Garenne. 2009: Savile is interviewed under caution by Surrey police investigating an alleged indecent assault at Duncroft school. The CPS advised there was insufficient evidence to take any further action. This was the year of the last offence recorded by the current investigation. Police have given another example offence dating from this year in which a 43-year-old woman was sexually assaulted by Savile on a train journey between Leeds and London. 2011: the scandal breaks 29 October: Jimmy Savile dies. Early November: A Newsnight investigation into Savile begins. Reporter Liz Mackean and researcher Hannah Livingston make contact with former Duncroft pupils. 11 November: A BBC tribute programme is aired on BBC1 called Jimmy Savile: As It Happened. 1 December: The Newsnight editor Peter Rippon emails reporter Meirion Jones telling him to stop working on other elements of the investigation because it is not strong enough without confirmation of the CPS angle and saying that he (Rippon) will pull the editing. Jones emails himself the \"red flag email\" in which he sets out what he sees as the consequences for the BBC if the story does not run. 5 December: Surrey police confirm that they investigated \"a historic allegation of indecent assault ... alleged to have occurred at a children's home in Staines in the 1970s\" and that they referred this to the CPS. 9 December: The CPS informs Jones it decided not to prosecute Savile because of lack of evidence and not because he was old or infirm. Rippon and Jones meet and Jones tells Rippon that he accepts the decision that he is not to pursue the story any more. 2012 8 January: The Sunday Mirror reports that the Newsnight investigation was axed and refers to a clash with the Fix It tribute show. 9 February: Miles Goslett reports in the Oldie that Newsnight's Savile investigation was pulled because of the tribute programmes and that allegations were made about abuse on BBC premises. The article alleges that the BBC had information the police did not and that Mark Thompson knew of the report. Further stories follow in the Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail. 7 September: The BBC receives a letter from ITV giving notice of the Exposure documentary on the Savile sex abuse allegations and posing questions. 3 October: The ITV Exposure programme on Savile is broadcast. 8 October: The BBC director-general George Entwistle appears on the Today programme. Mackean emails Entwistle to share her \"disquiet\" with \"the handling of the Newsnight Savile story\" and pointing out inaccuracy in an all-staff email. Entwistle asks Ken MacQuarrie, BBC Scotland director, to investigate the circumstances in which the Newsnight investigation was dropped. 22 October: The Panorama special on the BBC and Savile is broadcast. 23 October: Entwistle appears before the Commons culture, media and sport select committee. October: BBC asks Dame Janet Smith to investigate the culture and practices of the BBC in the decades that Savile worked there. 10 November: Entwistle resigns as director-general of the BBC. 2013 11 January: Scotland Yard labels Savile a \"prolific, predatory\" sex offender after its investigation reveals 214 criminal offences across 28 police forces, between 1955 and 2009.

{"text": "Ex-BBC DJ Jimmy Savile sexually assaulted victims aged five to 75 in NHS hospitals over decades of unrestricted access, investigators say. He assaulted patients in bed, and claimed to have abused corpses, reviews into his conduct on NHS premises found. The reports cover 28 hospitals including Leeds General Infirmary and Broadmoor psychiatric hospital. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt apologised to victims, saying Savile's actions \"will shake our country to the core\". 'Manipulative' Savile, a Radio 1 DJ who also presented the BBC's Top Of The Pops and Jim'll Fix It, died aged 84 in October 2011 - a year before allegations that he had sexually abused children were broadcast in an ITV documentary. The reports on Leeds General Infirmary and Broadmoor are detailed and, at times, graphic. They explain how Savile was allowed unsupervised access to vulnerable patients, with a failure to question the risks of his unconventional and promiscuous lifestyle. The Leeds investigation found: Sixty people came forward to say they had been abused between the ages of five and 75, including staff\nThe offences ranged from lewd remarks to sexual assault and three cases of rape and took place between 1962 and 2009\nOnly nine victims told members of staff. There were a further eight female victims who met Savile at the hospital, but were not patients\nSavile had a well-known fixation with the dead and the report contains allegations he posed for photographs and performed sex acts on corpses in the hospital mortuary\nWhile there is no way to verify the claim, Dr Sue Proctor - who led the Leeds inquiry - said there is no doubt controls on access to the mortuary were \"lax\"\nPatients, including teenagers recovering from surgery, were abused in their beds\nA 10-year-old boy was sexually assaulted while he waited on a trolley for an x-ray on his broken arm\nA number of organisational failures over the years enabled Savile to continue unchallenged\nThe situation allowed someone \"as manipulative as Savile to thrive and continue his abusive behaviour unchecked for years\" Mr Hunt told the Commons one victim being treated at Leeds General Infirmary feared she was pregnant after being abused. There were also reports that Savile made jewellery out of glass eyes taken from dead bodies from the hospital mortuary, he told MPs. A victim's story Sixty people have recounted how they were abused by Savile at Leeds General Infirmary, many were young people and teenagers. One victim \"Jane\" - who was 16 when she was assaulted - told the BBC Savile took her to a local shop to buy sweets and magazine, but soon afterwards sexually assaulted her in a hospital basement. \"He pulled me in immediately and started to kiss me with his tongue\", she said. \"At the same time his left hand went on to my right thigh under my dress.\" \"There was no conversation up until that point. I couldn't have said anything even if I'd wanted to, because he had his tongue in my mouth, which wasn't pleasant\". After the assault she said she felt \"dirty and ridiculously stupid\". She said she began to tell nurses about the incident but when they laughed felt she couldn't finish. \"All the staff accepted it, patients accepted it, clearly the porters accepted it as well.\" Mr Hunt apologised on behalf of the government and the NHS, saying of the victims: \"We let them down badly.\" The health secretary said there was a \"deep sense of revulsion\" over the findings. He added: \"As a nation, at that time we held Savile in our affection as a somewhat eccentric national treasure with a strong commitment to charitable causes. \"Today's report shows that in reality he was a sickening and prolific sexual abuser who repeatedly exploited the trust of a nation for his own vile purposes.\" Mr Hunt is writing to all NHS trusts asking them to ensure they are confident about patient safety. A spokesman for Prime Minister David Cameron said he was \"deeply shocked\", adding it was \"important lessons are learned\". 'Worst nightmare' The Leeds report was clear that no one person is to blame for what happened at the hospital other than Savile. But it did describe a lack of curiosity about his activities. Lesley McLean, Victim Support manager for West Yorkshire, said: \"The parents of the children [Savile] abused in Leeds hospitals were already anxious about their child's health. \"What they thought was a treat for their loved one was actually their worst nightmare.\" Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust issued a statement apologising to \"each and every one of Savile's victims\". \"There should have been far more scrutiny of him and what he was doing at our hospitals over the years, and more robust safeguards and internal controls in place to protect our staff and patients in our care,\" chief executive Julian Hartley said. In 1988, Savile was appointed by the Department of Health as the head of a taskforce overseeing Broadmoor. The report describes an inappropriate culture at Broadmoor that allowed sexual liaisons between staff and patients and discouraged reporting of concerns. The Broadmoor report found: Savile watched and made inappropriate comments when female patients stripped and showered naked in front of staff, a practice which was common in the late 1980s\nThe late DJ was \"narcissistic, arrogant and lacking in any empathy\"\nHe was also very manipulative and staff were convinced he had close connections in high places\nThere was \"no evidence that those responsible knew anything of the very much darker side\" to Savile that was later revealed\nEleven allegations of sexual abuse were reported to the review. Six of them involved patients, two staff and three children The report said the numbers were very likely to be an underestimate of the true picture because so many former patients simply wished to forget their time at Broadmoor. 'Feared sacking' Noami Stanley, a psychiatric nurse who treated patients who told her they had been abused by Savile at Broadmoor, said police and senior medical staff dismissed her concerns as an \"irritation\". She told BBC Radio 4's World at One: \"I explained what I heard and what I believed was going on in Broadmoor. \"There was a pair of police officers who appeared surprised and looked immediately to my superiors as if to say 'do something about this woman, she's nuts'.\" She said of the senior nursing officer present: \"He gave me quite a severe ticking office and said if I ever ever spoke out of turn like that again I would receive a disciplinary and might get sacked.\" Marjorie Wallace - now chief executive of the charity Sane - also visited the hospital regularly in the 1980s when she was researching a book. She said there was \"obviously something sinister\" about the DJ and attempted to raise the alarm after witnessing his treatment of two female patients: \"I went to the Department of Health and said 'What is Jimmy Savile doing here?\" But she says she was told Savile was bringing Broadmoor out of the \"dark ages\" and that he was a \"good person, liberating this closed institution\". Labour's Andy Burnham said giving Savile \"gold-plated keys\" to the hospital was \"one of the greatest failures in public protection and patient safety we've ever seen\". The shadow health secretary called for an over-arching, independent inquiry into the scandal. \"It would appear Savile was appointed to this role without any background checks at all,\" he told the BBC. \"There needs to be more independent scrutiny of how the government of the day handled this.\" Reports have been issued on: St Catherine's Hospital (Birkenhead); Saxondale Mental Health Hospital; Portsmouth Royal Hospital; Dewsbury and District Hospital (including Pinderfields Hospital); High Royds Psychiatric Hospital; Cardiff Royal Infirmary; Great Ormond Street Hospital; Exeter Hospital; Ashworth Hospital; Barnet General Hospital; Booth Hall; De La Pole Hospital; Dryburn Hospital; Hammersmith Hospital; Leavesden Secure Mental Health Hospital; Marsden Hospital; Maudsley Hospital; Odstock Hospital; Prestwich Psychiatric Hospital; Queen Victoria Hospital, East Grinstead; Royal Victoria Infirmary; Queen Mary's Hospital, Carshalton; Whitby Memorial Hospital; Wythenshawe Hospital, and Woodhouse Eaves Children's Convalescent Homes in Leicester. A report about Wheatfield's Hospice, which is run by the Sue Ryder charity, has also been released. Leicestershire Police has launched an investigation after one victim of Savile, who was abused as a young boy at a children's convalescent home in Woodhouse Eaves, told an enquiry team the entertainer was involved in the death of another child. However, no reference to a child's death could be found in the records of the home, Roecliffe Manor, which closed in 1969. Analysis by Nick Triggle, health correspondent, BBC News Since the allegations about Jimmy Savile came to light, the police have looked into how many victims there may have been. A review of why he was never prosecuted has also been carried out. But this is the most comprehensive account of how he was able to offend and get away with it for so long. Reviews into his behaviour at the BBC and care homes are expected later this year - and will no doubt shed even more light on the scandal. But for now the failings of the NHS - an institution that is there to care for the vulnerable - are in the spotlight. He enjoyed unsupervised access, particularly at two sites, Leeds General Infirmary and Broadmoor psychiatric hospital, and was able to use his fame to intimidate junior staff. What is more, senior management were too unquestioning. The reports are loathe to blame individuals. But with cases of abuse and improper conduct being reported up until 2009 - albeit much less frequently than in the 1960s and 1970s - the NHS has a lot of soul-searching to do. Hospital bedroom A key report into Savile's activities at Stoke Mandeville Hospital has been delayed after new information recently came to light. Savile had a bedroom at Stoke Mandeville, where his now-defunct charitable trust was based, as well as an office and living quarters at Broadmoor. Reports concerning two other hospitals - Rampton and Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Mental Health Trust - have also been delayed. It is understood investigations at two hospitals - the Royal Free Hospital in London and Pennine Acute NHS hospitals Trust - found nothing to report. The revelations made in a 2012 ITV documentary about Savile prompted more than 100 people to come forward, giving accounts of how they were sexually assaulted by Savile on NHS premises and in other places. A report by the NSPCC said Savile abused at least 500 victims, including some as young as two. BBC health reporter Pippa Stephens said there have been many significant changes in the law since the time Savile committed abuse.", "label": {"what": ["As a nation, at that time we held Savile in our affection as a somewhat eccentric national treasure with a strong commitment to charitable causes.

{"text": "The Health Secretary, responding to the publication of reports into the abuse at 28 NHS hospitals, says victims were \"let down badly\" and calls Savile a \"callous, opportunistic, wicked predator\" Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has apologised to the victims of Jimmy Savile's \"sickening\" sexual abuse, who were \"let down badly\" by the NHS over several decades. Giving the government's response to 28 independent reports, each covering a different NHS hospital, Mr Hunt acknowledged in the House of Commons the \"pain\" that many of the disc-jockey's victims are \"still reliving\". Mr Hunt said: \"Today I want to apologise on behalf of the Government and the NHS to all the victims who were abused by Savile in NHS-run institutions. \"We let them down badly and however long ago it may have been, many of them are still reliving the pain they went through. \"If we cannot undo the past, I hope that honesty and transparency about what happened can at least alleviate some of the suffering, it's the least we owe them.\" Mr Hunt said Savile repeatedly exploited the \"trust of a nation\" for his own \"vile purposes\" and that victims who spoke up were not believed. The Health Secretary stressed it was important to recognise the \"profoundly uncomfortable truth\" of what the victims went through. Mr Hunt told the Commons: \"I know this House, indeed the whole country, will share a deep sense of revulsion at what they (the investigations) revealed. \"A litany of disturbing accounts of rape and sexual abuse committed by Savile on vulnerable children and adults over a period of decades. \"At the time the victims who spoke up were not believed and it's important today that we all publicly recognise the truth of what they have said. \"But it is a profoundly uncomfortable truth. \"As a nation at that time we held Savile in our affection as a somewhat eccentric national treasure with a strong commitment to charitable causes. \"Today's report (says) that in reality he was a sickening and prolific sexual abuser who repeatedly exploited the trust of a nation for his own vile purposes.\" His description of Savile as previously being held in the nation's affection as a \"somewhat eccentric national treasure\" were met with shouts of \"no he wasn't\" from some on the Labour benches.

The Health Secretary said: \"Today's reports will shake this House and our country to the core. \"Savile was a callous, opportunistic, wicked predator who abused and raped individuals, many of them patients and young people who expected and had a right to expect to be safe. \"His actions span five decades, from the 1960s to 2010. \"The family favourite loved by millions courted popularity and used it to perpetrate and cover up his own evil acts. \"I, and I'm sure the whole House, will want to pay tribute to all the victims who came forward to talk about their experiences. \"It took great courage for them to relive their often extremely distressing and disturbing experiences. \"These reports paint a terrible picture as time and again victims were ignored or if they were not, little or no action was taken. \"The systems in place to protect people were either to weak or were ignored. \"People and institutions turned a blind eye.\"", "label": {"what": ["responding to the publication of reports into the abuse", "victims who spoke up were not believed", "he was a sickening and prolific sexual abuser who repeatedly exploited the trust of a nation for his own vile purposes"], "when": ["over several decades", "over a period of decades", "at that time", "span five decades", "from the 1960s to 2010"], "where": ["at 28 NHS hospitals", "in the House of Commons"], "why": ["were abused by Savile in NHS-run institutions", "We let them down badly", "Savile repeatedly exploited the 'trust of a nation' for his own 'vile purposes'", "we all publicly recognise the truth of what they have said", "Savile was a callous, opportunistic, wicked predator who abused and raped individuals", "time and again victims were ignored", "The systems in place to protect people were either to weak or were ignored"], "who": ["The Health Secretary", "Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt", "the Government", "the NHS", "all the victims", "the Commons", "Today's report", "some on the Labour benches", "individuals", "patients", "young people", "The family", "I", "the whole House"], "how": ["victims were 'let down badly'", "a 'callous, opportunistic, wicked predator'", "'sickening' sexual abuse", "Giving the government's response to 28 independent reports, each covering a different NHS hospital", "it was important to recognise the 'profoundly uncomfortable truth' of what the victims went through", "a profoundly uncomfortable truth", "victims being repeatedly ignored as people and institutions 'turned a blind eye'", "favourite loved by millions courted popularity and used it to perpetrate and cover up his own evil acts"], "damages": ["the victims of Jimmy Savile's 'sickening' sexual abuse, who were 'let down badly' by the NHS", "the 'pain' that many of the disc-jockey's victims are 'still reliving'", "the victims who spoke up were not believed"], "countermeasures": ["apologise on behalf of the Government and the NHS to all the victims", "honesty and transparency about what happened", "I, and I'm sure the whole House, will want to pay tribute to all the victims who came forward to talk about their experiences", "It took great courage for them to relive their often extremely distressing and disturbing experiences"], "perpetrators": ["Jimmy Savile"]}}
{"text": "The late BBC entertainer Jimmy Savile sexually assaulted victims ages 5 to 75 in hospitals across Britain over more than four decades, investigators say. A series of reports released Thursday found that Savile, who had unsupervised access to multiple hospitals as a celebrity fundraiser, abused both patients and hospital workers. Investigators said of the 60 alleged abuses at Leeds general infirmary, three were rapes. There were also reports Savile claimed to have performed sex acts on the dead. Dr. Sue Proctor, who led one of the investigations, said although the allegations could not be verified, access to hospital mortuaries in the 1980s was \"lax.\" According to The Telegraph, investigators were given \"macabre accounts\" of Savile \"acting unacceptably\" with dead bodies in the mortuary. Staff were told about some of the incidents, but no allegations reached senior managers, the report said.  According to investigators, although there was no way to prove Savile interfered with the bodies, \"it is evident his interest in the mortuary was not within accepted boundaries.\" According to The Telegraph, 19 of those who came forward were under 16 years old and 19 victims were female hospital staff members. Savile began working for the hospital radio service before becoming a regular visitor and volunteer porter, The Telegraph reported.  He had access to keys to several departments and had multiple offices in the hospital.

{"text": "Jimmy Savile was never a handsome man. His face, even in his early days at the BBC, was all sharp edges  the hook of his nose, the jagged-tooth grin, the boggle-eyed look of eccentricity, humor and derangement. At times, he seemed almost make believe. He had platinum hair. A fat cigar perpetually hung out of his mouth. He seemed to communicate exclusively in catchphrases: \"now then, now then,\" \"howzabout that then,\" \"as it appens.\" The kids just loved his gags. There was always something off about Savile, who hosted the BBC's \"Jim'll Fix it,\" palled around with the royal family, reportedly spent holidays with the Thatchers and was knighted not only by Queen Elizabeth but by Pope John Paul II. But most forgave his idiosyncratic nature. He was, after all, a great man. He raised $5.2 million for a hospital in Leeds, one of the United Kingdom's largest. He volunteered countless hours as a hospital aide, busing patients to and fro. He helped scores of young doctors get their starts. Sure, there were rumors. Whispers that he wasn't everything he seemed. Murmurs he was really a sexual predator and had abused dozens of children. But they never stuck. Not Jimmy Savile, people told themselves  not \"fix-it Jim.\" On October 29, 2011, Savile died at his home in Leeds. \"Most of all, I remember him as just a totally flamboyant, over-the-top, larger-than-life character,\" radio presenter David Hamilton told the Guardian, praising his \"tireless\" philanthropy. \"And as he was on the air, he was just the same off.\" But he wasn't. And just how wrong that assessment was emerged this month. Savile, according to a U.K. National Health Service investigation released Thursday, was a prolific pedophile. The health service investigation only confirmed behavior described in several earlier probes since his death. In all, Savile is believed to have abused at least 500 girls and boys, some as young as two, most between 13 and 15, as well as countless adults ranging up to 75 years old. With unfettered access to Leeds General Infirmary, the health service report said, he raped and fondled boys, girls, men and women in offices and corridors. He also allegedly committed sexual acts on dead bodies, and even told several hospital workers that he made jewelry out of one man's glass eyeball. As shocking as the findings are, even more shocking is the fact that Savile got away with it for so long. That realization has \"shaken our country to the core,\" U.K. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Thursday. For decades, while Savile hosted show after show and glad-handed, the abuse went on. Numerous columns have asked: How? How did no one know? Why wasn't he stopped? The answer, according to the National Health Service, psychologists, and academics, lies in the pervasive and intimidating power of celebrity. He was so well-known that even when his behavior struck some as strange or lewd, he was allowed to carry on because he was Jimmy Savile and was raising millions. \"I don't know if he were a law unto himself, but because of his celebrity status, he sort of basically had the run of the place,\" one hospital worker told investigators. One woman recalled Savile sexually assaulting her when she was 16. Even decades later, she told investigators, she remembered it vividly. After he was done, he turned an imperial eye to her. \"You won't talk about this,\" he told her. \"Nobody will believe you. I'm Jimmy Savile. I can get you.\" The girl said she told her mother, but she didn't believe her. The girl never talked about it again. Savile, wrote Ian Robertson, a professor of psychology at Trinity College Dublin, had a \"super-sense of being able to sniff out the most psychologically vulnerable who would either not tell or not be believed.  Here we have an associate of the highest echelons of British society. This halo likely acted like a protective force-field around him, not because of any collusion by any of the elite necessarily, but simply because of his repeated association with their own super-status.\" In 1960, when Savile was 34, he arrived at Leeds General Infirmary to begin a relationship with the sprawling institution that would last five decades. At first, he mostly dealt in fundraising. But in 1968, he had an unusual request: He wanted to become a \"porter\" and bus patients. \"When Mr. Savile offered his services as a voluntary porter I was a little concerned about the press implications and how he would fit into a busy teaching hospital,\" a hospital director later said. \"My concern was wholly unfounded and he has done an extremely good job and is accepted by all sections of the staff.\" Soon Savile, who described himself as the \"chief cheerer-upper\" and wore and a \"distinctive white coat\" embroidered with his name, ingratiated himself. He assumed a greater collection of privileges that included his own parking space and nearly limitless range of the facilities. He frequently parked his camper van overnight at the hospital, and workers would dispatch 8 a.m. coffee to its door. That power dampened some suspicion  but not all. When one woman \"went to shake his hand  he took my hand and kissed me on the back of my hand then sort of multiple kisses going up my arm towards my shoulder,\" she told investigators. \"I didn't feel confident enough to say, particularly because he was famous, to say, That's inappropriate.'\" Then, in a flash, Savile would revert back to his television persona. His behavior  mania, dissociation with his victims, split personalities  evinces something psychologists call a \"dark triad of personality characteristics.\" Psychologist Oliver James wrote that Savile was likely afflicted with psychopathy, Machiavellianism and narcissism. \"Such people often are able to slide effortlessly between personas.  Savile must have had a fantastical inner life  grandiose, wild and desperate.\" But for the most part, that's where it stayed: on the inside. And that obfuscation is what perhaps perpetuated the reported abuse. In a New Yorker piece on Jerry Sandusky, entitled \"In Plain View: How child molesters get away with it,\" Malcolm Gladwell said the most prolific pedophile is rarely the \"disheveled old man baldly offering candy to preschoolers.\" Rather, pedophiles can be agreeable members of the community. \"People didn't believe that [he] was a pedophile because people liked [him]  without realizing that [he] was in the business of being likeable.\" And few in Britain during the 1970s and 1980s were more liked than Jimmy Savile.", "label": {"what": ["he was really a sexual predator and had abused dozens of children", "Savile died at his home in Leeds", "Savile, according to a U.K. National Health Service investigation released Thursday, was a prolific pedophile", "He assumed a greater collection of privileges that included his own parking space and nearly limitless range of the facilities"], "when": ["On October 29, 2011", "this month", "Thursday", "After he was done", "In 1960", "in 1968", "Soon", "during the 1970s and 1980s"], "where": ["Leeds General Infirmary", "in offices and corridors", "In a New Yorker piece on Jerry Sandusky", "in Britain"], "why": ["With unfettered access to Leeds General Infirmary", "the pervasive and intimidating power of celebrity", "He was so well-known", "he was Jimmy Savile and was raising millions", "because of his celebrity status, he sort of basically had the run of the place", "had a 'super-sense of being able to sniff out the most psychologically vulnerable", "This halo likely acted like a protective force-field around him", "his repeated association with their own super-status", "That power dampened some suspicion", "was likely afflicted with psychopathy, Machiavellianism and narcissism", "are able to slide effortlessly between personas", "that obfuscation is what perhaps perpetuated the reported abuse", "people liked [him] without realizing that [he] was in the business of being likeable", "few in Britain during the 1970s and 1980s were more liked than Jimmy Savile"], "who": ["radio presenter David Hamilton", "the Guardian", "a U.K. National Health Service investigation", "the health service report", "U.K. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt", "Numerous columns", "the National Health Service", "psychologists", "academics", "one hospital worker", "One woman", "Ian Robertson, a professor of psychology at Trinity College Dublin", "the highest echelons of British society", "the sprawling institution", "a hospital director", "Psychologist Oliver James", "Malcolm Gladwell"], "how": ["got away with it for so long", "shaken our country to the core", "For decades, while Savile hosted show after show and glad-handed, the abuse went on", "Even decades later, she told investigators, she remembered it vividly", "he turned an imperial eye to her", "she told her mother, but she didn't believe her", "never talked about it again", "would either not tell or not be believed", "last five decades", "he has done an extremely good job and is accepted by all sections of the staff", "He frequently parked his camper van overnight at the hospital, and workers would dispatch 8 a.m. coffee to its door", "His behavior mania, dissociation with his victims, split personalities evinces", "a 'dark triad of personality characteristics"], "damages": ["Savile is believed to have abused at least 500 girls and boys, some as young as two, most between 13 and 15, as well as countless adults ranging up to 75 years old", "he raped and fondled boys, girls, men and women", "He also allegedly committed sexual acts on dead bodies", "made jewelry out of one man's glass eyeball", "Savile sexually assaulting her when she was 16", "went to shake his hand he took my hand and kissed me on the back of my hand then sort of multiple kisses going up my arm towards my shoulder"], "countermeasures": ["The health service investigation only confirmed behavior described in several earlier probes since his death", "Numerous columns have asked: How?

{"text": "Disgraced DJ and presenter Jimmy Savile subjected patients in NHS hospitals across the country to \"truly awful\" sexual abuse for more than four decades, a series of chilling reports have revealed. Savile's victims at hospitals ranged from five-year-old children to 75-year-old pensioners and included men, women, boys and girls, who were patients, visitors and staff, an investigation into claims of abuse at 28 NHS hospitals including Broadmoor psychiatric hospital has found. Investigators were given \"macabre accounts\" of Savile \"acting unacceptably\" with dead bodies in the mortuary at Leeds General Infirmary. One witness was cited in the report as saying he claimed he wore huge rings that he said were made from the glass eyes of dead bodies held in the mortuary there. The investigation heard the entertainer claimed to have \"interfered with the bodies of deceased patients\". Dr Sue Proctor, who led the investigation into his abuse at LGI, said a student nurse recalled a conversation with Savile in which he claimed he performed sex acts on the dead. She said there is no way of verifying the claims regarding corpses, but said it should be considered in context that controls around access to the mortuary in the 1980s were \"lax\". At Broadmoor, investigators found \"clear failings\" in the way access to wards was controlled, as Savile had keys allowing him unrestricted access within the security perimeter. Female patients there in the 1980s were often required to strip and bathe in front of staff, during which Savile would often watch and sometimes made inappropriate comments, the report found. It said his \"flamboyantly inappropriate\" attitude towards women was considered as part of his public act, \"just Jimmy\". The report also described an inappropriate culture of sexual relations between staff and patients. Fewer assaults were reported to have taken place at Broadmoor than other hospitals, but the inquiry attributed the smaller number of complaints to an atmosphere of fear among staff as to what might happen if they did report incidents. Members of staff at the LGI also failed to take complaints of abuse to senior managers, who could have acted to prevent it from re-occurring. The reports on LGI, which Savile had a 50-year-association with, and Broadmoor are the most extensive to emerge. It comes after allegations that he had abused children were broadcast during an ITV documentary in 2012, which saw over 100 people come forward with accounts of abuse at the hands of Savile in hospitals. This prompted individual investigations by hospital trusts, which was overseen by Kate Lampard QC for the Department of Health. The Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has issued an apology to the victims on behalf of the government in the Commons over Savile's \"sickening\" actions, saying: \"We let them down badly.\" He said: \"At the time the victims who spoke up were not believed and it's important today that we all publicly recognise the truth of what they have said. [...] Today's report (says) that in reality he was a sickening and prolific sexual abuser who repeatedly exploited the trust of a nation for his own vile purposes.\" NHS chiefs described the findings of the investigations as \"truly awful\" in a joint statement, while the current chief executives of Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust and West London Mental Health NHS Trust, which covers Broadmoor, apologised to victims. The inquiry into his activities at LGI after his association with the hospital began in 1960 included the testimonies of 60 people who gave accounts of their experiences with Savile - 33 of these were patients. Three of these incidents were rapes, the investigators said. The Leeds team said 19 of those who came forward were under 16 years old and the age range was five to 75. They said the majority were teenagers but 19 victims were hospital staff - all women. At Broadmoor, investigators found sexual relationships between staff and patients were tolerated in what was a \"clear, repeated failure of safeguarding standards\". Eleven complaints of sexual abuse were reported to investigators, involving three children, six patients and two members of staff. A key report into his activities at Stoke Mandeville Hospital has been delayed after new information recently came to light. A separate report by the NSPCC also found Savile abused at least 500 victims.", "label": {"what": ["Jimmy Savile subjected patients in NHS hospitals across the country to truly awful sexual abuse", "Investigators were given 'macabre accounts' of Savile 'acting unacceptably' with dead bodies", "he wore huge rings that he said were made from the glass eyes of dead bodies held in the mortuary there", "Savile would often watch and sometimes made inappropriate comments", "he had abused children", "the victims who spoke up were not believed", "19 of those who came forward were under 16 years old and the age range was five to 75", "A key report into his activities at Stoke Mandeville Hospital has been delayed", "A separate report by the NSPCC also found Savile abused at least 500 victims"], "when": ["in the 1980s", "after allegations", "during an ITV documentary in 2012", "At the time the victims who spoke up", "today", "after his association with the hospital began in 1960"], "where": ["in NHS hospitals across the country", "at 28 NHS hospitals including Broadmoor psychiatric hospital", "in the mortuary at Leeds General Infirmary", "at LGI", "At Broadmoor", "in hospitals", "in the Commons", "in a joint statement", "at Stoke Mandeville Hospital"], "why": ["Savile had keys allowing him unrestricted access within the security perimeter", "were often required to strip and bathe in front of staff", "an atmosphere of fear among staff as to what might happen if they did report incidents", "new information recently came to light"], "who": ["Investigators", "One witness", "The investigation", "the entertainer", "Dr Sue Proctor", "a student nurse", "Female patients", "the report", "Members of staff", "Kate Lampard QC for the Department of Health", "The Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt", "Today's report", "NHS chiefs", "the current chief executives of Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust", "West London Mental Health NHS Trust", "The Leeds team", "the NSPCC"], "how": ["for more than four decades", "interfered with the bodies of deceased patients", "controls around access to the mortuary in the 1980s were 'lax'", "found 'clear failings' in the way access to wards", "his 'flamboyantly inappropriate' attitude towards women", "his 'flamboyantly inappropriate' attitude towards women was considered as part of his public act", "at the hands of Savile", "was overseen by Kate Lampard QC for the Department of Health", "in reality he was a sickening and prolific sexual abuser who repeatedly exploited the trust of a nation for his own vile purposes", "the majority were teenagers but 19 victims were hospital staff - all women", "three children, six patients and two members of staff"], "damages": ["Savile's victims at hospitals ranged from five-year-old children to 75-year-old pensioners", "included men, women, boys and girls, who were patients, visitors and staff", "Three of these incidents were rapes", "sexual relationships between staff and patients were tolerated in what was a 'clear, repeated failure of safeguarding standards'", "abused at least 500 victims"], "countermeasures": ["an investigation into claims of abuse", "One witness was cited in the report", "a student nurse recalled a conversation with Savile in which he claimed he performed sex acts on the dead", "failed to take complaints of abuse to senior managers", "The reports on LGI, which Savile had a 50-year-association with, and Broadmoor are the most extensive to emerge", "were broadcast", "over 100 people come forward with accounts of abuse", "prompted individual investigations by hospital trusts", "issued an apology to the victims on behalf of the government in the Commons over Savile's 'sickening' actions", "we all publicly recognise the truth of what they have said", "described the findings of the investigations as 'truly awful'", "apologised to victims", "The inquiry into his activities at LGI after his association with the hospital began in 1960 included the testimonies of 60 people who gave accounts of their experiences with Savile - 33 of these were patients", "Eleven complaints of sexual abuse were reported to investigators"], "perpetrators": ["DJ and presenter Jimmy Savile"]}}
{"text": "DJ and TV host Jimmy Savile was a larger-than-life personality. And a report released Thursday confirms he was also an extravagant sexual predator, using his access to hospitals as a volunteer porter and fundraiser to abuse victims aged from 5 to 75. The review of Savile's behavior at 28 hospitals across the United Kingdom makes shocking reading, detailing a catalog of abuses against some of Britain's most vulnerable people over the course of decades. Protected by his celebrity and exploiting a network of relationships he built in hospitals, he carried out rapes, other sexual abuse and displayed an unhealthy interest in dead bodies in a hospital mortuary. Worse, the abuse went unchecked and unpunished, since the BBC entertainer died before the allegations against him were made public. UK Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt apologized in the House of Commons on Thursday to all the victims abused by Savile while in the care of the National Health Service -- and said the system had let down those who were brave enough to raise the alarm but had their complaints ignored. \"Savile was a callous, opportunistic, wicked predator who abused and raped individuals, many of them patients and young people, who expected and had a right to expect to be safe. His actions span five decades -- from the 1960s to 2010,\" Hunt said. \"The family favorite loved by millions courted popularity and used it to perpetrate and cover up his own evil acts.\" Victims who complained were \"time and again\" ignored, or if heard, little or no action was taken, Hunt said. \"People and institutions turned a blind eye.\" \"As a nation at that time we held Savile in our affection as a somewhat eccentric national treasure with a strong commitment to charitable causes,\" Hunt said. \"Today's reports show that in reality he was a sickening and prolific sexual abuser who repeatedly exploited the trust of a nation for his own vile purposes.\" Victims' ages from 5 to 75 'Abused and raped patients without scruple' For a generation who grew up watching Savile on TV's \"Top of the Pops\" and his children's program \"Jim'll Fix It,\" the revelations that first emerged in 2012 were deeply disturbing. Thursday's report into the full extent of his offending against children and adults, patients and staff, in 28 hospitals -- particularly Leeds Infirmary and Broadmoor Hospital, a high-security psychiatric institution -- will do nothing to reassure them. The Leeds Infirmary report reveals a sexual predator who, while volunteering as a porter, \"abused and raped patients without scruple,\" said Hunt. Some 60 people reported abuse to the Leeds investigation, including a teenager who believed she was pregnant as a result of Savile's actions, he said. \"Two witnesses told the investigation Savile claimed to have had jewellery made from glass eyes taken from bodies in the mortuary,\" Hunt added, saying that other claims were too horrific to recount in parliament. The report cites one witness who tells how Savile recounted making trips to the hospital mortuary, where he claimed to have manipulated bodies before rigor mortis set in, taken photographs and performed sex acts on them. The report's authors say they have \"no way of proving Savile's claim that he interfered with the bodies of deceased patients in the mortuary.\" However, it is established that he \"publicly declared his interest in the dead,\" that he visited a friend who worked in the mortuary and that controls were lax for many years. \"In light of the claims about the glass eye jewellery and Savile's interference with the bodies of the deceased, it is evident his interest in the mortuary was not within accepted boundaries,\" it concludes. 'Very manipulative' The report from Broadmoor said 10 people had alleged they were sexually assaulted by Savile, plus a case of indecent exposure involving a minor. The investigation concluded that at least five people were sexually abused and a sixth was more likely than not to have been. Five other victims could not be contacted for detailed accounts. The report gives an insight into how Savile was able to gain a position of influence at the secure institution that included giving him keys to wards and allowing him to watch female patients undress to bathe. \"Savile could be charming and persuasive, at least to some, but at the same time he was grandiose, narcissistic, arrogant and lacking any empathy,\" it states. \"He was also very manipulative, and many staff were convinced that he had close connections in high places and had the power to have them dismissed.\" Una O'Brien, permanent secretary of the Department of Health, said in a statement that \"inadequate processes\" had allowed Savile to gain the position of authority at Broadmoor that aided his abusive behavior. \"While much has changed in the intervening years we will leave no stone unturned to make sure such appalling actions can never be repeated; our thoughts today are with the people who suffered and continue to suffer from these terrible crimes,\" she said. The UK's NSPCC children's charity said more must be done to safeguard children and ensure that an apparent \"culture of turning a blind eye\" to abuse is not repeated. \"To hear that some hospital staff may have actively facilitated Savile's abuse of children is sickening and takes the scandal of his crimes to yet another abhorrent level,\" said Peter Watt, national services director for the charity. \"Savile escaped justice because people didn't want to hear or believe what children were saying. Ministers now need to be satisfied that this could never happen again and that children and vulnerable adults in hospitals or any government facility are safe today.\" Savile died in October 2011 at age 84, soon after being treated in a hospital for pneumonia.

{"text": "LONDON  The British health authorities said on Thursday that inquiries into sexual abuse by the disgraced television host Jimmy Savile at state-funded medical facilities had revealed \"truly awful\" episodes involving patients ages 5 to 75. The disclosures were the latest addition to a catalog of malfeasance that has shocked Britons and shaken the British Broadcasting Corporation, Mr. Savile's onetime employer. The investigation at National Health Service institutions followed police investigations into allegations of abuse at several locations, including Leeds General Infirmary in his hometown and a high-security psychiatric unit visited by Mr. Savile under the guise of charitable work. The entertainer gained access to every corner of the hospital in Leeds by working on its radio service and volunteering as a porter as part of his fund-raising efforts, the investigation found. The inquiry concluded that the first case of abuse at the Leeds hospital occurred in 1962 and the most recent in 2009, when Mr. Savile was 82. While some victims complained to the staff, either directly or through their parents, their allegations were not passed on to those in higher authority. The inquiry concluded that the first case of abuse at the Leeds hospital occurred in 1962 and the most recent in 2009, when Mr. Savile was 82. While some victims complained to the staff, either directly or through their parents, their allegations were not passed on to those in higher authority. \"For some, although the abuse took place decades ago, their experience endures as a painful and upsetting memory that still has an effect on them today,\" said Sue Proctor, who headed the inquiry. She called Mr. Savile's professed interest in the dead \"pretty unwholesome,\" quoting an unidentified student nurse as saying the entertainer had boasted of performing acts of a sexual nature on corpses. The cigar-chomping Mr. Savile, who died in 2011 at age 84, was widely seen for decades as a kind of national treasure for his zany fashion sense, quirky mannerisms and supposed philanthropy. Only after he died did long-rumored misbehavior come to light in hundreds of reports of abuse of women, girls and boys. The disclosure of his activities also provoked police investigations that led to trials of several entertainers accused of sexual offenses. A joint statement by National Health Service executives said there had been \"truly awful\" episodes dating to 1960, when Mr. Savile began volunteering at the Leeds hospital in northeastern England. Research by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children found that, all told, he abused at least 500 victims, the youngest of them 2 years old. The BBC, which is funded by compulsory license fees paid by viewers, conducted its own inquiries into its relationship with Mr. Savile. One of them raised the question of why the broadcaster canceled a contentious report into accusations of sexual abuse against Mr. Savile in December 2011, two months after he died. At the time, the BBC's director general was Mark Thompson, who joined The New York Times Company as president and chief executive in 2012. In December 2012, an inquiry by Nick Pollard, a veteran British broadcast executive, blamed lax leadership and \"rigid management chains\" that left the BBC \"completely incapable\" of dealing with the Savile affair. But Mr. Pollard's 200-page report did not challenge Mr. Thompson's assertions that he had no role in canceling the BBC's Savile report and was unaware of the sexual abuse accusations until he left the BBC in September 2012. Neither did the report fault Mr. Thompson for missing opportunities to learn the details of the allegations against Mr. Savile.", "label": {"what": ["inquiries into sexual abuse", "revealed 'truly awful' episodes involving patients ages 5 to 75", "The disclosures were the latest addition to a catalog of malfeasance that has shocked Britons and shaken the British Broadcasting Corporation", "the first case of abuse at the Leeds hospital occurred in 1962", "the most recent in 2009, when Mr. Savile was 82", "their allegations were not passed on to those"], "when": ["on Thursday", "in 1962", "in 2009", "in 2011", "after he died", "dating to 1960", "in December 2011, two months after he died", "In December 2012", "ntil he left the BBC in September 2012"], "where": ["LONDON", "at state-funded medical facilities", "at National Health Service institutions", "at several locations", "Leeds General Infirmary", "a high-security psychiatric unit", "in Leeds", "at the Leeds hospital", "in higher authority", "at the Leeds hospital in northeastern England", "The New York Times Company"], "why": ["his zany fashion sense, quirky mannerisms and supposed philanthropy", "lax leadership and 'rigid management chains' that left the BBC 'completely incapable' of dealing with the Savile affair"], "who": ["The British health authorities", "the British Broadcasting Corporation", "The investigation", "The inquiry", "Sue Proctor", "The disclosure of his activities", "National Health Service executives", "the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children", "The BBC", "Mark Thompson", "an inquiry by Nick Pollard, a veteran British broadcast executive"], "how": ["visited by Mr. Savile under the guise of charitable work", "gained access to every corner of the hospital", "by working on its radio service and volunteering as a porter as part of his fund-raising efforts", "either directly or through their parents", "had boasted of performing acts of a sexual nature on corpses", "raised the question of why the broadcaster canceled a contentious report into accusations of sexual abuse against Mr. Savile", "as president and chief executive in 2012", "had no role in canceling the BBC's Savile report", "was unaware of the sexual abuse accusations"], "damages": ["their experience endures as a painful and upsetting memory that still has an effect on them today", "he abused at least 500 victims, the youngest of them 2 years old"], "countermeasures": ["police investigations into allegations of abuse", "some victims complained to the staff", "long-rumored misbehavior come to light in hundreds of reports of abuse of women, girls and boys", "The disclosure of his activities also provoked police investigations", "trials of several entertainers accused of sexual offenses", "conducted its own inquiries into its relationship with Mr. Savile"], "perpetrators": ["the disgraced television host Jimmy Savile", "The entertainer"]}}
{"text": "Jimmy Savile raped a teenager who fell pregnant and then coached her to 'threaten suicide' if she was not given an abortion, it emerged today. The 16-year-old was one of more than 100 harrowing cases studies revealed in NHS reports which also laid bare how the paedophile DJ abused corpses and made jewellery from dead patients' glass eyes. The girl was raped by Savile in Leeds, and told investigators: 'I was frightened I might be pregnant, and of course I told my mum. We went to the GP. 'I told Savile that I was going and he said, \"Well when you go you must say to him, if I am pregnant and you don't do anything about it, I will put my head in the gas oven\". 'He says \"don't forget, you must say that to him,\" and he had me repeating it'. But the GP agreed to the abortion and 'left the room and came back with a little paper cup with two pink tablets in and a glass of water and said \"take those\",' she said. For the following two days she bled and after a follow-up appointment her doctor it was confirmed she was not pregnant. Her father then went to the same GP himself because he was so furious about what had happened to his daughter. A doctor's note read: 'I understand the parents will be having a word with the gentleman concerned. I hope it will scare him off.' Her father was also advised: 'If I was you I'd go to Savile's house and write on the wall in red paint \"Jimmy Savile is a b*****d\". The 'psychopathic' paedophile was given free rein across the NHS for almost 50 years by 'starstruck' staff. A series of internal investigations published yesterday charted how the DJ became the most prolific sex attacker in living memory. The mass of NHS reports into his crimes published yesterday revealed how Savile boasted about having sex with corpses and had jewellery made from glass eyes he removed from their bodies. The sick paedophile also gloated to others that he?K?QEW???Me enjoyed 'posing' with the corpses and said that he would 'wheel them around' at night at Leeds General Infirmary. Investigators discovered the late DJ and Top of the Pops presenter claimed at least 103 victims aged between five and 75. Starstruck NHS workers allowed Savile free reign to sexually abuse patients and hospital staff 'didn't want to hear or believe' what his young victims were saying, the report said. They detailed his 50 year reign of terror at 28 institutions including Leeds, Broadmoor and Stoke Mandeville hospital. One witness told investigators that Savile revealed the origin of his 'gross, big silver rings' when she remarked on them. He said: 'D'you know what they are? They are glass eyes from dead bodies in Leeds Mortuary where I work and I love working there, and I wheel the dead bodies around at night and I love that.' Another, unconnected witness - who was employed at the hospital - added: 'I do remember seeing this ring he had on that looked like an eyeball and - and I must've mentioned it to him. 'He said: 'It's made from the eyeball of a dead friend.'' A former nurse at Broadmoor Hospital said Savile told her about his appalling activities in Leeds. He said he would 'muck about' posing dead bodies of men and women together before taking photographs. She said: 'I was a little bit upset because I had no concept, in those days, of - while I'd heard of necrophilia ... but I didn't understand what it meant.' The nurse added that Savile said he sexually assaulted the bodies as well, something he dubbed 'garamoosh' - a reference to oral sex. A former patient at Barnet General Hospital in London said nurses told her in 1983 that Savile 'liked to have sex with dead bodies'. Today's report discussed how Savile had openly talked about his interest in the dead in media interviews over the years. He told one interviewer about spene?K?QEW???Mding five days with the dead body of his mother. The chairwoman of the independent investigation, Dr Sue Proctor said Savile had 'expressed an interest in the dead' and said he 'would take bodies to the morgue and carried out sex acts on them'. He also said he 'wore huge rings that he said were made from the glass eyes of dead bodies,' she said. The 28 reports outline in unprecedented detail Savile's sordid crimes between 1962 and 2009. Officials spoke to hundreds of witnesses and retrieved thousands of archived documents. They revealed how Savile used his charming and manipulative personality to open the doors of hospitals and access their most vulnerable patients. He also used his fundraising activities as a cover to further his predatory sexual attacks, which targeted men and women, staff and patients. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has today apologised on behalf of the Government and the NHS for letting down the victims and David Cameron's official spokesman said the report findings are 'deeply shocking and underline why it's important that lessons are learnt.' Jimmy Savile's victims at Leeds General Infirmary (LGI) ranged from five-years-old to pensioners and included men, women, boys and girls. Investigators at the hospital found that staff were told about some of the incidents but no allegations reached senior managers. The inquiry into his activities at LGI after he started his association in 1960 included the testimonies of 60 people who gave accounts of their experiences with Savile to investigators - 33 of these were patients. Three of these incidents were rapes, the investigators said. The Leeds team said 19 of those who came forward were under 16-years-old and the age range was five to 75. They said the majority were teenagers but 19 victims were hospital staff - all women. The inquiry panel said that he started working on the hospital radio serve?K?QEW???Mice and he then became a regular visitor to the hospital, as a celebrity, a fundraiser and, from 1968, a volunteer porter. It said Savile enjoyed unrestricted access to the hospital as he raised 3.5 million through his charity activities. This gave him the opportunities he needed to indulge in abusive and inappropriate contact with patients and staff. He had access to keys to various departments, had a series of offices in the hospital and even had access to the mortuary, the panel said. The independent investigation interviewed more than 200 people and reviewed more than 1,300 documents covering the 50 years Savile was associated with LGI, which is now run by the Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust. It found that the first case of abuse reported to the team happened in 1962 when Savile was 36. The most recent was in 2009 when he was 82. The investigation panel found that incidents ranged from lewd remarks and inappropriate touching to sexual assault and, in three cases, rape. Forty three of the encounters took place in public areas such as wards, corridors and offices. The investigators found that nine victims told a member of staff about what happened either directly or through their parents at the time of the abuse. But they said none of these allegations were subsequently communicated to people in more senior positions. Among the 28 hospitals investigated were Moss Side, in Liverpool, which is now one of three top-security mental hospitals in England, along with Rampton and Broadmoor. Two female former patients accused Savile of sexually abusing them in a ward and a third allegation came from a male ex-patient who claimed that he witnessed Savile stroke a patient's breast at a hospital social event. Broadmoor operated in an environment where sexual relationships between staff and patients were tolerated. There was a 'clear, repeated failure of safeguarding standards', the independent invese?K?QEW???Mtigation found. Not only was the inappropriate behaviour tolerated, but the atmosphere in the institution discouraged reporting, it was concluded. The report found 'clear failings' in the way access to some wards was controlled and supervised. Savile had keys allowing him unrestricted access to ward areas within the security perimeter. Indeed, after being briefed on new security arrangements in 2004 Savile stopped his visits to the hospital. It was not until five years later that his right to keys was formally withdrawn. Investigators found Savile raped a woman in a motor home at Digby Hospital, a mental hospital in Exeter in 1970, while a former patient at the mental health unit at High Royds Hospital, Leeds claimed Savile inappropriately touched people during a fancy dress fun run in the 1980s. Reporting their findings, the panel said: 'It is clear from witness interviews that had senior managers at the hospital been made aware of Savile's abusive behaviour, they would have acted to stop it happening.' Dr Sue Proctor, said: ''Before saying anything about our findings, I want to commend the courage of those former patients, staff and visitors to Leeds General Infirmary who experienced abusive or inappropriate encounters with Savile. 'Because they came forward voluntarily and told us what happened to them, the NHS in Leeds and across the country now has an opportunity and an obligation to learn from their accounts and make sure that what happened in Leeds at the hands of Savile can never happen again. 'The NHS is in their debt and I am truly grateful to each of them.' Dr Proctor said: 'For some, although the abuse took place decades ago, their experience endures as a painful and upsetting memory that still has an effect on them today.' One child repeatedly abused by Jimmy Savile from the age of nine was so desperate to avoid being visited by the paedophile she cycled off a bridge. The girl fell 15ft and broke her arm but said the DJ still tracked her down and sexually assaulted her again as she recovered in a Leeds hospital. She was so traumatised by Savile's repeated abuse she avoided treatment for a large birthmark on her face in case the star found her, and instead tried to wash it off at home with bleach. The unnamed woman is one of more than 500 victims who were attacked by Savile, considered Britain's worst ever paedophile, who died at 84 in 2011 having never been brought to justice. Today 28 NHS trusts published reports revealing how their patients and staff were habitually abused by Savile. Some ignored complaints and even gave him keys, private rooms and access to basements where he could grope or even rape his victims. In other cases staff also agreed to move people from their beds to his accommodation, where he abused them. At Leeds General Infirmary Savile himself was also made chief porter while working as a DJ, giving him access to all patients. The girl who cycled off a bridge said Savile targeted her because she was disfigured, and used her to boost his own profile. On one occasion she was picked up in his Rolls Royce and taken for laser surgey at St James' Hospital in Leeds. 'Savile began to kiss my port-wine stain. He nuzzled into my neck and put his hand up my skirt,' she told The Sun. Over three years he continued to abuse her, even after she jumped from the Yorkshire bridge. She said: 'Again he kissed and slavered over me. I knew I couldn't stop him.\" She ended treatment telling her parents: \"I'd rather live with my birthmark\".' Another victim said that she was taken by a porter to the basement at Leeds General and abused. She said she told nurses what happened but 'they just laughed'. Their cases have been considered as part of a wider investigation into his abuse on NHS premises, primarily in Leeds and the hie?K?QEW???Mgh-security psychiatric Broadmoor Hospital. He also abused many at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire, but their report has been delayed until the autumn. NSPCC figures show of his hundreds of victims the most common age group was 13 to 15 - and the youngest alleged victim was just two years old. He abused both girls and boys. In addition, fears that Savile abused children in more than 20 children's homes and schools across England are also being investigated. Allegations dating back to the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s have been handed to the Department for Education (DfE) following a review of documents by the Metropolitan Police. Local authorities and other relevant institutions have been asked to further investigate the claims, Education Secretary Michael Gove said in a written statement. Among children's homes and schools to be further investigated are Henshaw School for the Blind, one of four institutions in Savile's birthplace of Leeds, and a Barnardo's children's home in the London Borough of Redbridge. Children's homes and schools in focus are spread across England. These include areas like Bournemouth, Devon, Gloucestershire, Leeds, London and Manchester among others. Edwina Currie said last night she regretted ever setting eyes on Jimmy Savile. The former health minister told the Guardian the reports were 'upsetting for everyone involved'. An NHS inquiry found civil servant Cliff Graham appointed Savile to the Broadmoor taskforce and Miss Currie later rubber-stamped the decision. She was supportive of Savile's promises to confront the Prison Officers Association about working practices, and said at the time: 'He is an amazing man and has my full confidence.'

{"text": "Modern medicine will come to an end unless the world develops a new generation of antibiotics, the chief medical officer for England has warned. The intervention from Prof Dame Sally Davies echoed that of David Cameron, who said antibiotic-resistant superbugs threatened to send medicine \"back into the dark ages\". In a series of interviews, Davies said she welcomed the prime minister's initiative in asking Jim O'Neill, a former Goldman Sachs chief economist, to lead an international expert group to consider how drug companies can be encouraged to make new antibiotics. \"I am delighted to see the prime minister taking a global lead by commissioning this review to help new antibiotics to be developed and brought to patients effectively,\" she said. Davies told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that antibiotic-resistant infections were a grave problem that was getting worse. In England, she said, 5,000 people die from antibiotic-resistant infections a year: \"Deaths are increasing and there is an empty pipeline of drugs.\" Davies went on to warn that surgery for hip transplants and caesareans, and treatment for diseases such as cancer would be hard to carry out if there were no means to kill off random infections in patients. \"Modern medicine would quickly go out of the window,\" she said. Dr Louise Leong, of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said antibiotics were a victim of their own success through overuse and low prices, adding there was a need for a new economic model bringing together the private and public sectors. Leong told the Today programme that this was already happening through the Innovative Medicines Initiative, Europe's largest public-private sector medical collaboration to tackle big health challenges, including antibiotic resistance. The pharmaceutical industry has little incentive to invest in research for drugs that are not taken every day and so do not reap large profits. But Davies pointed out that unless the companies deal with antibiotic resistance, their drugs for cancer and other illnesses will not sell if antibiotics no longer work. The pharmaceutical industry has produced three generations of antibiotics in the past 60 years. The first included natural penicillins. However, this group became ineffective as bacteria evolved enzymes that broke the drugs apart. The second were synthetic penicillins, modified in the lab to resist these enzymes, but bugs gained resistance to these too. The third generation, carbapenems, have been further modified. In 2003, the first microbes arrived in Britain that are immune to even these. Cameron, who this month called for immediate action to accelerate the development of drugs for dementia, is said to have raised the problem of antibiotic-resistant superbugs during last year's G7 summit. O'Neil's review is expected to focus on the development and regulation of antibiotics. The initial 500,000 cost of the work will be met by the Wellcome Trust. The Department of Health said the review will come up with a plan for encouraging and accelerating the discovery and development of new generations of antibiotics.In particular, it will consider: how to make investment in new antibiotics more attractive to pharmaceutical firms; the balance between effective and sustainable incentives for investment; how governments and other funders can stimulate investment in new antimicrobials; and increasing international cooperation, including much closer working with poor countries. The review will present its initial findings during 2015 with a final report and recommendations to then follow during 2016. This process will run alongside the World Health Organisation's development of a global action plan on antimicrobial resistance. Cameron has described the emergence of untreatable bacteria as one of the biggest health threats facing the world today. \"This is not some distant threat, but something happening right now,\" he told the Times. \"If we fail to act, we are looking at an almost unthinkable scenario where antibiotics no longer work and we are cast back into the dark ages of medicine, where treatable infections and injuries will kill once again. That simply cannot be allowed to happen and I want to see a stronger, more coherent global response.\" Experts cautioned, however, that antibiotic resistance is a natural phenomenon that cannot be readily stopped, only managed. \"Developing new antibiotics will help manage the growing problem of resistance to currently available drugs,\" said Professor Alan Johnson, an expert in antibiotic resistance surveillance at Public Health England. \"Unfortunately, it is not the whole answer as resistance to any new drugs is also likely to develop over time. At a global level, we need to improve our antibiotic stewardship and infection prevention and control practices, as well as developing better diagnostic tests so that infections are treated with the most appropriate antibiotic at an early stage. Combined, these actions would help to stem the speed at which resistance to existing and new antibiotics develops and help to prolong the use of these critically important drugs.\" Mark Dosher, secretary to the Bella Moss Foundation (BMF), a pet charity, said: \"It has to be recognised that new antibiotics could result in new resistance pathogens so we have to look into other areas, from hygiene and environment to the lifestyle of individuals and which people C and animals C are more prone to infection. David Cameron's taskforce is a good idea C as long as it doesn't solely focus on the cost and regulation of new drugs. Just concentrating on financial incentives for health companies to create new drugs would be a mistake in the long-term.\"", "label": {"what": ["said antibiotic-resistant superbugs threatened to send medicine 'back into the dark ages'", "5,000 people die from antibiotic-resistant infections a year", "Deaths are increasing", "surgery for hip transplants and caesareans, and treatment for diseases such as cancer would be hard to carry out", "The pharmaceutical industry has little incentive to invest in research for drugs that are not taken every day and so do not reap large profits", "The pharmaceutical industry has produced three generations of antibiotics in the past 60 years", "bugs gained resistance to these", "the first microbes arrived in Britain that are immune to even these", "have raised the problem of antibiotic-resistant superbugs during last year's G7 summit", "Cameron has described the emergence of untreatable bacteria as one of the biggest health threats facing the world today"], "when": ["In 2003", "this month", "during last year's G7 summit", "during 2015", "during 2016", "the dark ages", "over time", "at an early stage", "in the long-term"], "where": ["the world", " In England", "In a series of interviews", "in patients"], "why": ["to help new antibiotics to be developed and brought to patients effectively", "through overuse and low prices", "not taken every day", "as bacteria evolved enzymes that broke the drugs apart"], "who": ["the chief medical officer for England", "Prof Dame Sally Davies", "David Cameron", "the prime minister", "Jim O'Neill, a former Goldman Sachs chief economist", "BBC Radio 4", "Dr Louise Leong, of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry", "Today programme", "the Wellcome Trust", "The Department of Health", "poor countries", "World Health Organisation", "the Times", "Experts", "Professor Alan Johnson, an expert in antibiotic resistance surveillance at Public Health England", "Mark Dosher, secretary to the Bella Moss Foundation (BMF)"], "how": ["by commissioning this review", "lead an international expert group", "modified in the lab to resist these enzymes", "bringing together the private and public sectors", "through the Innovative Medicines Initiative"], "countermeasures": ["develops a new generation of antibiotics", "focus on the development and regulation of antibiotics", "make investment in new antibiotics more attractive to pharmaceutical firms", "balance between effective and sustainable incentives for investment", "stimulate investment in new antimicrobials", "increasing international cooperation", "improve our antibiotic stewardship and infection prevention and control practices", "developing better diagnostic tests"]}}

{"text": "The world could soon be \"cast back into the dark ages of medicine\" unless action is taken to tackle the growing threat of resistance to antibiotics, Prime Minister David Cameron has said. He has announced a review into why so few anti-microbial drugs have been introduced in recent years. Economist Jim O'Neill will lead a panel including experts from science, finance, industry, and global health. It will set out plans for encouraging the development of new antibiotics. 'Taking the lead' The prime minister said: \"If we fail to act, we are looking at an almost unthinkable scenario where antibiotics no longer work and we are cast back into the dark ages of medicine where treatable infections and injuries will kill once again.\" Mr Cameron said he discussed the issue at a G7 leaders meeting in Brussels earlier this month and got specific support from US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. It is hoped that the review panel's proposals will be discussed at next year's G7 summit, which will be hosted by Germany. \"Penicillin was a great British invention by Alexander Fleming back in 1928,\" Mr Cameron told the BBC. \"It's good that Britain is taking the lead on this issue to solve what could otherwise be a really serious global health problem.\" He said the panel would analyse three key issues: the increase in drug-resistant strains of bacteria, the \"market failure\" which has seen no new classes of antibiotics for more than 25 years, and the over-use of antibiotics globally. 'Time bomb' It is estimated that drug-resistant strains of bacteria are responsible for 5,000 deaths a year in the UK and 25,000 deaths a year in Europe. Chief Medical Officer for England Prof Dame Sally Davies has been a key figure helping to get the issue on the government and global agenda. Last year she described the threat of antimicrobial resistance as a \"ticking time bomb\" and said the dangers it posed should be ranked along with terrorism. She spoke at a meeting of scientists at the Royal Society last month which warned that a response was needed akin to efforts to combat climate change. Dame Sally said: \"I am delighted to see the prime minister taking a global lead by commissioning this review. \"New antibiotics made by the biotech and pharmaceutical industry will be central to resolving this crisis which will impact on all areas of modern medicine.\" Medical research charity the Wellcome Trust is providing 500,000 of funding for Mr O'Neill and his team, which will be based at their headquarters in central London. Antimicrobial resistance has been a key issue for Jeremy Farrar, since he became director of the Wellcome Trust last year. \"Drug-resistant bacteria, viruses and parasites are driving a global health crisis,\" he said. \"It threatens not only our ability to treat deadly infections, but almost every aspect of modern medicine: from cancer treatment to Caesarean sections, therapies that save thousands of lives every day rely on antibiotics that could soon be lost.\" 'Market failure' Antibiotics have been an incredible success story, but bacteria eventually develop resistance through mutation. One example is MRSA, which has been a major threat for years in hospitals. It is resistant to all but the most powerful of antibiotics, and the main weapon against it is improved hygiene, which cuts the opportunity for infection to spread. Without antibiotics a whole raft of surgical procedures would be imperilled, from hip replacements to cancer chemotherapy and organ transplants. Before antibiotics, many women died after childbirth after developing a simple bacterial infection. Mr O'Neill is a high-profile economist who is best-known for coining the terms Bric and Mint - acronyms to describe countries which are emerging and potential powerhouses of the world economy. He is not, though an expert on antibiotics or microbes. But Mr Cameron told the BBC it was important to have an economist heading the review: \"There is a market failure; the pharmaceutical industry hasn't been developing new classes of antibiotics, so we need to create incentives.\" Jeremy Farrar said: \"This is not just a scientific and medical challenge, but an economic and social one too which would require analysis of regulatory systems and behavioural changes to solve them.\" Mr O'Neill will begin work in September and is expected to deliver his recommendations next spring.

{"text": "The prime minister has called for global action to tackle the threat of resistance to antibiotics. In a BBC interview, David Cameron will announce a review to identify why the market has failed to deliver new drugs and to formulate proposals to take to the G7 next year. Below are two viewpoints on the issue. Peter Taylor, Professor of Microbiology, UCL School of Pharmacy Antibiotics are probably the safest and most efficacious drugs ever produced but they have an Achilles heel. Every time we use an antibiotic it alters the levels of bacteria out there in the environment and engenders resistance in a way that is very similar to Darwinian natural selection. In fact what we are seeing is evolution in speeded-up time so antibiotic resistance can develop very quickly. The industry was very good at developing new antibiotics during the so-called golden age of antibiotic discovery during the late forties up to the mid 1980s. But since then for various reasons there has been a lack of investment and a lack of success in finding new drugs. I think we can apply new technologies for a new phase of antibiotic drug discovery. We are trying to take a different approach - to disarm the bacteria - modify them in such a way that they are no longer able to cause infection and this strategy does work, we have shown this in a number of models of infection. We found that some components in Japanese green tea are able to insert into the membranes of strains of MRSA - the superbug which causes very many lethal infections in hospitals. It basically converts the bacteria from being fully resistant to our front line drugs - the cephalosporin's and the penicillin's - to make them become completely susceptible to these drugs. The idea is we can use these agents alongside conventional drugs that have lost their utility because of the emergence of resistance. Patrick Vallance, President of R and D, GlaxoSmithKline There are three basic problems - one is it is actually really difficult to discover new antibiotics; it is not a trivial exercise. Bacteria kick out chemicals - that is what they do, they live in a toxic environment. Second, is it is difficult to do clinical trials, it is difficult to operationalise those in hospitals, and the third is there is a big economic disincentive in a way. We have got a couple of drugs in development going through late stage clinical trials so we are excited about that. I am not going to stand here and say we have a great pipeline coming through which is going to solve this problem because we haven't, and nobody has, and there needs to be more effort here. We've spent something like a $1bn over the last 10-12 years on antibiotic research and development. We have one drug come through for skin infections which is licensed and a couple in the late stage pipeline now and we've got some earlier things but you know that's a lot of money to spend. Antibiotics if they come through get very low pricing so we don't expect a great return on investment for that money that we have spent. I think part of the problem is that in society people are prepared to pay quite a lot of money for cancer drugs - some of the prices are up in the hundreds of thousands of pounds a year type price range. New antibiotics as compared with an old antibiotic? Pennies. So the price is very different for the two and of course it is a very short treatment duration very often but it can have equally big effects so there is this disparity in how society values the two types of medicines.", "label": {"what": ["The prime minister has called for global action", "developing new antibiotics", "a lack of investment and a lack of success in finding new drugs", "We are trying to take a different approach", "this strategy does work", "we have shown this in a number of models of infection", "We found that some components in Japanese green tea are able to insert into the membranes of strains of MRSA", "We have got a couple of drugs in development going through late stage clinical trials", "spent something like a $1bn over the last 10-12 years on antibiotic research and development", "one drug come through for skin infections which is licensed", "a couple in the late stage pipeline now", "we don't expect a great return on investment for that money that we have spent"], "when": ["next year", "Every time we use an antibiotic", "during the so-called golden age of antibiotic discovery", "during the late forties up to the mid 1980s", "since then", "over the last 10-12 years", "now"], "where": ["In a BBC interview", "in hospitals", "in society"], "why": ["tackle the threat of resistance to antibiotics", "they have an Achilles heel", "evolution in speeded-up time", "for various reasons", "to disarm the bacteria", "cause infection", "causes very many lethal infections", "because of the emergence of resistance", "difficult to discover new antibiotics", "Bacteria kick out chemicals - that is what they do, they live in a toxic environment", "difficult to do clinical trials", "difficult to operationalise those in hospitals", "because we haven't, and nobody has", "Antibiotics if they come through get very low pricing", "people are prepared to pay quite a lot of money for cancer drugs", "some of the prices are up in the hundreds of thousands of pounds a year type price range", "a very short treatment duration very often but it can have equally big effects"], "who": ["The prime minister", "David Cameron", "the G7", "two viewpoints on the issue", "Peter Taylor, Professor of Microbiology, UCL School of Pharmacy", "The industry", "this strategy", "some components in Japanese green tea", "MRSA - the superbug", "the cephalosporin", "the penicillin", "Patrick Vallance, President of R and D, GlaxoSmithKline", "three basic problems", "Bacteria", "New antibiotics", "old antibiotic", "the price"], "how": ["it alters the levels of bacteria out there in the environment", "engenders resistance in a way that is very similar to Darwinian natural selection", "converts the bacteria from being fully resistant to our front line drugs - the cephalosporin's and the penicillin's - to make them become completely susceptible to these drugs"], "countermeasures": ["David Cameron will announce a review", "identify why the market has failed to deliver new drugs", "formulate proposals to take to the G7", "apply new technologies for a new phase of antibiotic drug discovery", "modify them", "use these agents alongside conventional drugs that have lost their utility", "there needs to be more effort"]}}
{"text": "Prime Minister David Cameron called on Wednesday for global action to tackle the threat of drug-resistant superbugs and said Britain planned to take a leading role in finding ways to spur the development of new antibiotics. A world without effective antibiotics would push medicine back into the \"dark ages\", he said, with routine surgery, treatments for cancer and organ transplants potentially becoming impossible. Cameron announced an independent review led by former Goldman Sachs chief economist Jim O'Neill to pinpoint the problems and identify why so few new antibiotics are being developed. O'Neill will bring together experts from around the world, reflecting the global nature of the superbug threat. Cameron said he had discussed the issue at a G7 summit of leaders in Brussels last month and had won specific support for the initiative from U.S. President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. \"This is a very serious threat. We are in danger of going back to the dark ages in medicine, to see infections that were treatable not be treatable,\" he said in BBC interview. \"We have to grip it globally because this is a problem that will affect every country in the world and Britain is providing leadership to make that happen.\" The O'Neill Commission will be hosted and funded by the Wellcome Trust charity, which is contributing 500,000 pounds ($850,000) to the project. Drug resistance is driven by the misuse and overuse of antibiotics, which encourages bacteria to develop new ways of overcoming them. Resistance has been a feature of medicine since Alexander Fleming's discovery of the first antibiotic, penicillin, in Britain in 1928. But the problem has become worse in recent years as multi-drug-resistant bugs have developed and drug companies have reduced investment in an unprofitable field. Unlike big sellers such as statins for lowering cholesterol, antibiotics are used for only short periods and doctors also tend to keep the newest and most potent ones in reserve. Prices for antibiotics are also low, reflecting the availability of many cheap generic versions, in contrast to treatments for other diseases such as cancer. RACE AGAINST EVOLUTION Recent years have seen the emergence of strains of infections, including tuberculosis, malaria, pneumonia and gonorrhoea, that resist all known drugs. Only a handful of new antibiotics have been developed and brought to market in the past few decades, and it is a race against time to find more as bacterial infections increasingly evolve into superbugs resistant to even the most powerful last-resort medicines reserved for extreme cases. One of the best known superbugs, MRSA, is alone responsible for tens of thousands of deaths in the United States and Europe, as well as untold numbers in poorer countries. Cameron's decision to set up the O'Neill Commission follows a call by scientists in May for a independent body on antimicrobial resistance, modelled on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In one promising sign, Swiss drugmaker Roche recently said it was returning to the antibiotic field - but its move runs counter to a gradual drift to the exit by Big Pharma over the past decade.

{"text": "The Prime Minister calls for united action amid fears manageable illnesses like pneumonia and tuberculosis could kill huge numbers The world could be \"cast back into the dark ages of medicine\" where people die from treatable infections because deadly bacteria are becoming resistant to antibiotics, David Cameron has warned. The Prime Minister has called for governments and drug companies around the world to work together to \"accelerate\" the discovery of a new generation of antibiotics. His intervention comes amid fears in the medical profession that manageable illnesses like pneumonia and tuberculosis could kill huge numbers of people like they did early in the twentieth century. About 25,000 people die annually across Europe because of infections that are resistant to antibiotic drugs, Mr Cameron said. Mr Cameron is to announce an independent review led by Jim O'Neill, the economist, to identify why the international market has failed to bring forward new drugs. The Prime Minister wants to set out a plan for encouraging and accelerating the discovery and development of a new generation of powerful drugs. GPs could also be told to stop prescribing antibiotics when they are not needed. \"For many of us, we only know a world where infections or sicknesses can be quickly remedied by a visit to the doctor and a course of antibiotics,\" Mr Cameron said. \"This great British discovery has kept our families safe for decades, while saving billions of lives around the world. \"But that protection is at risk as never before. \"Resistance to antibiotics is now a very real and worrying threat, as bacteria mutates to become immune to its effect.\" Overuse of antibiotics for minor infections has resulted in bacteria becoming resistant to medicines. Drug companies now invest less money in new antibiotics because they cost so much to develop. Patents for many antibiotics have expired, leading more companies to join the market. It means the drug firms are making smaller profits and investing less in vital cures. Mr Cameron said: \"With some 25,000 people a year already dying from infections resistant to anti-biotic drugs in Europe alone, this is not some distant threat but something happening right now. \"If we fail to act, we are looking at an almost unthinkable scenario where antibiotics no longer work and we are cast back into the dark ages of medicine where treatable infections and injuries will kill once again. \"That simply cannot be allowed to happened and I want to see a stronger, more coherent global response, with nations, business and the world of science working together to up our game in the field of antibiotics.\" Mr Cameron held discussions with world leaders about the issue last month at a meeting of the G7. The lack of new drugs which are capable of fighting bacteria has been described by the World Health Organisation as one of the most significant global risks facing modern medicine. Without urgent action the world is heading for a post-antibiotic era, experts have warned. Mr O'Neill's review will focus on the development, use and regulatory environment around antibiotics. It will explore how to make investment in new antibiotics more attractive to pharmaceutical companies and other funding bodies.

{"text": "As a young doctor in the 1980s, too many ward rounds brought a sense of despair. Time and again, I could offer only compassion as young, previously healthy adults succumbed to a new infectious disease we had no power to treat. HIV provoked a sense of helplessness not only among patients and those at risk, but also among their doctors. Our skills and training meant little without drugs that worked. HIV, in the rich world at least, has gone on to become a treatable illness. The development of anti-retroviral drugs has allowed people to live with the virus, often for decades, without becoming ill. Yet they have not been cured, and they live with a spectre. For it is not a matter of whether HIV will evolve resistance to these drugs, but when. That is what viruses do. We have not, thankfully, reached that point with HIV yet. But the same is not true of dozens of other infectious agents, which we had been complacent enough to assume our drugs had defeated. Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, E. coli and salmonella are now prevalent across the globe. Most strains of gonorrhoea are resistant to front-line antibiotics. MRSA and C. difficile have become household-name superbugs. In Myanmar, Thailand and across South East Asia, malaria is resistant to the artemisinin combination therapies that have done so much to reduce its lethal footprint . The World Health Organisation warned recently of a post-antibiotic age . It is already here. Drug-resistant pathogens have created the world's greatest emerging health crisis. Its impact is profound because barely any aspects of modern medicine will be untouched. Antimicrobial resistance does not only threaten our ability to treat infections that count victims in millions C malaria, HIV and TB. It will undermine much else besides, in rich and poor countries alike. Cancer is not generally caused by bacteria, but treating it relies on antibiotics, to prevent the infections that would otherwise defeat immune systems compromised by chemotherapy. Operations we think of as routine C hip replacements, Caesarean sections C appear so only because we have drugs that protect surgical incisions against opportunistic germs. As we lose antibiotics, we wind back the clock on medical progress. We have long known that this was a risk. As Alexander Fleming noted in 1945 , when accepting the Nobel Prize for Medicine for penicillin, it is a fact of biology that microbes, exposed to selective pressures through drugs, will evolve and adapt. Our behaviour has turned ultimate inevitability into proximate disaster. Evolution cannot be stopped, but it can be delayed through good stewardship of existing antimicrobials, to buy time for drug discovery and vaccines. Yet overuse and misuse of precious drugs has accelerated their obsolescence, while we have failed to invest in and incentivise the development of new ones to take their place. Let doctors use drugs to help terminally ill patients die, says health expert 01 Jul 2014 If Labour can't win on the NHS, then it really is in intensive care 02 Jul 2014 Swimming lessons for babies cause ripple effect HSBC This is a wicked problem. Antimicrobial resistance is on one level a scientific challenge. We need to understand better how pathogens evolve, how they can be targeted, and how they can quickly be diagnosed. But it is a social and economic issue as well. It is about how doctors prescribe, and what their patients demand of them. It is about regulation and public policy, how antibiotics old and new are deployed. It is about animals as well as people: 80 per cent of the USA's antibiotic use is on farms, not in clinics . And it is about the right incentives for science and industry. It costs hundreds of millions of pounds to bring a new antimicrobial to market, yet the logic of public health is that such agents will be used sparingly, for short periods, or even kept entirely in reserve. For many pharma and biotech companies, the sums don't add up. Add to all this that pathogens, resistant or not, do not respect borders. What is in London today will be in Shanghai tomorrow and vice versa. Treating infections effectively, without side effects or unintended consequences, relies on good diagnosis and evidence-based medicine. The same will be true of tackling resistance. That is why I am delighted that David Cameron has appointed Jim O'Neill, to lead an independent review of these issues, which the Wellcome Trust is proud to fund and host. Much as another economist, Lord Stern, reframed climate change as much more than a scientific question, I hope Jim will help us to think of drug resistance as a challenge for the whole of society, which affects us all. It will require a web of actions from many stakeholders to solve. Dr O'Neill enjoys advantages that Lord Stern did not. While drug resistance is comparable in complexity to climate change, it does not stir ideological division in the same way. It is also emerging as an issue that clearly resonates with public opinion: it is encouraging that antibiotics won a popular vote in the UK last week to become the focus of the 10 million Longitude Prize . What this means is that the diagnoses and prescriptions that this review suggests should be able to command agreement across national and political divides, and popular support for urgent action.

{"text": "When ebola first struck Pujeh, a village deep in Sierra Leone's forested interior region, residents did what they always do when a mysterious illness brings death: they consulted the traditional healer. But the elderly herbalist soon caught one of the world's most contagious diseases, and then became a source for spreading it as visitors streamed in. By the time officials had pinpointed Pujeh as a hotspot for the disease months later, dozens had died. \"The people living in these areas said there's no such thing as ebola,\" said a district doctor who spoke on condition of anonymity. \"They have their traditional beliefs and their traditional cures and they look up to their traditional leaders. Until we can bring the traditional leaders onside, it will be very difficult to convince them that ebola even exists.\" As the death toll from the latest outbreak of the world's deadliest virus climbed to 467 C far exceeding the previous most lethal outbreak which killed 254 people in Congo C officials and health workers are battling a surge of infections propelled by misinformation and doubt about the disease's existence on one side, and mistrust of scandal-hit governments on the other. Following a Doctors Without Borders warning that the illness is \"out of control\" in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, west African health ministers on Wednesday began a two-day summit in Ghana's capital of Accra to discuss ways to strengthen regional co-operation. The World Health Organisation has also warned four other west African countries C Ivory Coast, Senegal, Mali and Guinea Bissau C to prepare for the possible arrival of travellers carrying the virus. Some government officials have disputed the WHO's statement, saying the increasing death toll is a sign of better surveillance. \"We are not saying everything is okay but there are fewer people dying in silence now, which is a good thing C the more we can identify when and where there are fatalities, the better we can prevent further cases,\" health ministry official Sakouba Keita said from Guinea's capital of Conakry. The country has been the hardest hit by the virus, which first appeared there in February, before spreading through the tropical forests that sprawl into Liberia and Sierra Leone. More disturbingly, it has also jumped to all three countries' densely-populated capitals. \"This is different from other cases just by the fact it's a cross-border epidemic. Previous outbreaks have been very localised, which makes them easier to isolate and contain. Now for the first time, it's also affecting urban areas,\" said Dr Nestor Ndayimirije, Liberia's WHO representative who has handled epidemics in several other countries. Ebola was first identified in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sudan in 1976, which suffered simultaneous outbreaks of different strains miles apart. It was named after Congo's Ebola river, where its most lethal mutation C the Zaire strain C infected 318 people and killed 280. Described by virologists as a \"molecular shark\", ebola is believed to be hosted by the fruit bat, a delicacy in Guinea and Liberia. The current strain is at least the fifth mutation since its discovery in 1976. Diagnosis is often complicated by the fact symptoms mirror those of malaria, common in the region, including fever, vomiting and diarrhoea. Victims sometimes have horrific internal and external bleeding and most die of shock or multiple organ failure, although chances of survival increase dramatically if adequate treatment is received early on. No cure exists for ebola but confirmed cases are first quarantined before undergoing intensive rehydration therapy. Due to its high contagion rate, medical workers should wear head-to-toe biohazard suits even when dealing with dead patients. Weak public health systems have also undermined attempts to halt the disease. Sierra Leone and Liberia are both recovering from decades of back-to-back civil wars, while half a century of dictatorship in Guinea ended in 2010. Daily reports from Liberia's ministry of health provide a glimpse of just how big the hurdles are. On the eve of the regional summit, two suspected cases from Voinjama had travelled to the capital Monrovia C but specimens hadn't been collected because \"the county laboratory supervisor could not be found,\" internal notes said. The report also warned of an acute shortage of thermometers among a team dispatched to trace those who might have been in contact with suspects. Many of them feared taking temperatures in case they were exposed to the disease or attacked by locals, it added. But an alarmingly wide spread is partly down to geography. \"The deaths have been increasing because of traditional burial rites in that region,\" said Tolbert Nyenswah, Liberia's deputy chief medical officer. The Kissi ethnicity, found in all three countries, traditionally keep their dead at home for several days, and mourners touch the deceased's head frequently before burial. Ebola has a fatality rate of up to 90% and is transmitted through contact with fluids of infected people or animals, like urine, sweat, blood and saliva, even after death. A doctor in Sierra Leone said patients' families often attempted to break them out of treatment centres C often successfully. \"Some of them are in denial and that it is something they can treat at home, and faith healers are one of the problems for us. When you have patients disappearing like that, you don't know where the virus will appear next.\" When trader Fiya Lasana was diagnosed with suspected ebola in a clinic in Sierra Leone's Kailahun district, he was put under quarantine. But convinced he had only malaria, he slipped out. Days later he returned, weak and dazed, for treatment. \"My family tried prayers, but that didn't work, so I returned,\" said Lasana, who was declared ebola-free after eleven days. Liberia's president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, on Monday issued a warning on state radio that anyone suspected of holding ebola patients in homes or churches would be prosecuted. The disease has also revealed alarming mistrust between citizens and public office holders in a region with shocking corruption levels. Ebola was initially viewed as a government conspiracy to depopulate Sierra Leone's Kailahun district, and fierce resistance to the arrival of health workers culminated in the stoning of a Doctors Without Borders vehicle. In Liberia, many remain adamant the outbreak is a hoax from government officials seeking to distract from a series of recent scandals, or for health officials to rake in public funds. \"I will say this loud, the government of Liberia has come up with a new strategy to divert the Liberian people's mind,\" student Alfred Randall said. \"We understand the issue of ebola, ebola is real, we agree the virus is a very terrible virus, but ebola is not in Liberia,\" he said. Health workers at the frontline of the battle C often the first to die C face other challenges. Last week, riots broke out and an ambulance was attacked as family members fought to reclaim a victim's corpse from a hospital in Kenema, Sierra Leone's third largest city. On the same day, a three-man burial team was chased out of the Liberian town of Banjol where they went to bury a victim. \"We need to find a special place to bury these corpses, if not, the bodies will keep piling up on us,\" a member of the team said, adding that families often refused to come forward to identify dead relatives for fear of catching it. Officials and several hundred researchers who have poured into all three countries have scrambled to disseminate public information, seen as key to containment. But when the outbreak first began, popular text messages circulating in Guinea said an antidote could be found in a concoction of hot chocolate, coffee, milk, raw onions and sugar. \"Ebola, ebola, ebola. I hear it everywhere,\" said Adama Sherry from behind her market stall in Sierra Leone's Tombo, a fishing village as yet unaffected by the virus. Sherry admitted she couldn't list the symptoms, causes or precautions. Nearby, a local school had recently emptied out when word spread of routine blood tests being carried out C rumour had it that the needles would infect children with ebola. Liberia's health ministry has begun putting images of ebola-ravaged corpses in newspapers and on television. \"They are very graphic but it is working C people are starting to see that ebola is not just a spiritual thing that you can cure through going to church,\" Nyenswah, the deputy chief medical officer, said. Ironically, survivors often face a \"second disease\" of stigmatisation. Aissata Bangoura's family have refused to speak to her since her husband died in March, even though she has been declared virus-free. \"During my husband's wake, I was left standing by myself. People I have known my whole life didn't want to approach me. As far as they're concerned, I'm a widow and a leper,\" she said.

{"text": "With deaths from Ebola virus soaring to 467 in West Africa, and Doctors Without Borders warning the outbreak is spreading \"out of control,\" pressure is growing to offer experimental medicines to the sick and dying. Jeremy Farrar, a professor of tropical medicine and director of The Wellcome Trust charity, said global health authorities should rethink their approach to potential treatments. \"We have more than 450 deaths so far  and not a single individual has been offered anything beyond tepid sponging and 'we'll bury you nicely',\" Farrar told Reuters in an interview. \"It's just unacceptable.\" His remarks come as the World Health Organization (WHO)  which is warning other states to prepare for Ebola heading their way  hosts a meeting of West African health ministers in Ghana this week to try to strengthen the region's response. The normal drug development process  of years of testing new drugs in animals, then in healthy human volunteers before they are tested patients and approved by regulators  takes too long and should not apply in rapidly spreading outbreaks of diseases like Ebola, Farrar said. West Africa is battling its deadliest outbreak of Ebola, which causes fever, vomiting, bleeding and diarrhea, and can kill between 50 and 90 per cent of those it infects. Farrar pointed to several experimental drugs and vaccines in development by U.S.- and U.K.-based companies as potential treatments or preventative measures against Ebola, and questioned why they were not being tested in a situation where people at high risk might benefit. \"It's ridiculous that we haven't got these (experimental) products out of labs and animal trials and into human testing, and at least offered to people,\" he said. The pipeline of drugs being developed for Ebola is far from bulging  partly due to a lack of research money for a medicine which is likely to be needed mainly in poor countries with scant healthcare funds. But several small biotech companies and U.S. university departments are developing potential vaccines, and Tekmira Pharmaceuticals, which teamed up with the U.S. Department of Defence on an injectable drug for Ebola, started an initial Phase I trial in healthy volunteers in January. U.S.-based Inovio and privately held Vaxart are among those with experimental vaccines in animal testing, while GlaxoSmithKline last year acquired Swiss vaccine firm Okairos with an early-stage Ebola product. Will happen again Farrar noted that while Ebola is a relatively rare disease, outbreaks have come regularly since the virus was first identified some 40 years ago, and can be predicted to happen in future  making testing potential drugs a sensible approach. \"This is not the first time this has happened, and it will happen again  we know that,\" he said. \"And we could all have pushed for having stockpiles (of experimental drugs) maybe held in Geneva, and they could have had WHO ethical approval, and then we'd be ready to go (when the next outbreak comes).\" The WHO said on Tuesday it believed three key factors were contributing to the spread of Ebola in the region: The burial of victims in accordance with cultural practices and traditional beliefs in rural communities.\nThe dense population around the capital cities of Guinea and Liberia.\nCommercial and social activity along the borders of the three countries.\nFear and mistrust are also driving dozens of victims to evade treatment, frustrating foreign and local doctors trying to contain the epidemic. Doctors Without Borders says Ebola is \"out of control,\" located in at least 60 places across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Basic methods Both the WHO and Doctors Without Borders (also known as Mdecins Sans Frontires), which has been heavily engaged in handling the outbreak on the ground, have said the top priority must be containing Ebola with basic but vital infection control measures such as vigilant hand washing and hygiene, and isolation of infected patients. Farrar acknowledged these were crucial, but said health organizations need to consider experimental drugs in their planning for the future. \"There are candidate vaccines out there, and candidate drugs, and whilst I absolutely agree that the most important things are infection control and making sure people can't pass it on, ultimately you do have to move these things (candidate drugs) out and start offering them to people,\" he said. A University of Texas Medical Branch researcher, Tom Geisbert, told Reuters in March he was developing a potential Ebola vaccine, which had shown good results in animal tests and could, he said, be offered on \"compassionate grounds\" to people at risk in the current outbreak.", "label": {"what": ["deaths from Ebola virus soaring to 467 in West Africa", "We have more than 450 deaths so far", "West Africa is battling its deadliest outbreak of Ebola", "The pipeline of drugs being developed for Ebola is far from bulging partly", "GlaxoSmithKline last year acquired Swiss vaccine firm Okairos", "Ebola is 'out of control,'"], "when": ["this week", "in January", "last year", "40 years ago", "on Tuesday", "in March", "so far"], "where": ["in West Africa", "in Ghana", "in poor countries with scant healthcare funds", "U.S.-based Inovio", "in the region", "in rural communities", "around the capital cities of Guinea and Liberia", "in at least 60 places across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone"], "why": ["the outbreak is spreading 'out of control,'", "try to strengthen the region's response", "takes too long", "we haven't got these (experimental) products out of labs and animal trials", "a lack of research money for a medicine", "outbreaks have come regularly since the virus was first identified", "The burial of victims in accordance with cultural practices", "traditional beliefs in rural communities", "The dense population around the capital cities of Guinea and Liberia", "Commercial and social activity along the borders of the three countries", "Fear and mistrust", "be offered on 'compassionate grounds'"], "who": ["Doctors Without Borders", "the sick and dying", "Jeremy Farrar, a professor of tropical medicine and director of The Wellcome Trust charity", "global health authorities", "Reuters", "the World Health Organization (WHO)", "healthy human volunteers", "regulators", "West Africa", "U.S.- and U.K.-based companies", "people at high risk", "several small biotech companies", "U.S. university departments", "Tekmira Pharmaceuticals", "the U.S. Department", "Vaxart", "GlaxoSmithKline", "Okairos", "dozens of victims", "Doctors Without Borders", "Mdecins Sans Frontires", "A University of Texas Medical Branch researcher", "Tom Geisbert", "people at risk in the current outbreak"], "countermeasures": ["rethink their approach to potential treatments", "hosts a meeting of West African health ministers", "several experimental drugs and vaccines in development", "started an initial Phase I trial in healthy volunteers", "teamed up with the U.S. Department of Defence", "are among those with experimental vaccines in animal testing", "acquired Swiss vaccine firm Okairos with an early-stage Ebola product", "have pushed for having stockpiles (of experimental drugs) maybe held in Geneva", "which has been heavily engaged in handling the outbreak", "vigilant hand washing and hygiene", "isolation of infected patients", "There are candidate vaccines out there, and candidate drugs"], "how": ["pressure is growing to offer experimental medicines to the sick and dying", "not a single individual has been offered anything", "which causes fever, vomiting, bleeding and diarrhea, and can kill between 50 and 90 per cent of those it infects", "making testing potential drugs", "evade treatment", "frustrating foreign and local doctors trying to contain the epidemic", "need to consider experimental drugs in their planning for the future", "ultimately you do have to move these things (candidate drugs) out and start offering them to people"]}}
{"text": "West African states lack the resources to battle the world's worst outbreak of Ebola and deep cultural suspicions about the disease remain a big obstacle to halting its spread, ministers said on Wednesday. The outbreak has killed 467 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone since February, making it the largest and deadliest ever, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). West African health ministers meeting in Ghana to draw up a regional response mixed appeals for cash with warnings of the practices that have allowed the disease to spread across borders and into cities. Abubakarr Fofanah, deputy health minister for Sierra Leone, a country with one of the world's weakest health systems, said cash was needed for drugs, basic protective gear and staff pay. Sierra Leone announced on Wednesday that President Ernest Bai Koroma, his vice president and all cabinet ministers would donate half of their salaries to help fight the outbreak, though the total amount of the donations was not disclosed. \"In Liberia, our biggest challenge is denial, fear and panic. Our people are very much afraid of the disease,\" Bernice Dahn, Liberia's deputy health minister, told Reuters on the sidelines of the Accra meeting. \"People are afraid but do not believe that the disease exists and because of that people get sick and the community members hide them and bury them, against all the norms we have put in place,\" she said. Authorities are trying to stop relatives of Ebola victims from giving them traditional funerals, which often involve the manual washing of the body, out of fear of spreading the infection. The dead are instead meant to be buried by health staff wearing protective gear. Neighboring Sierra Leone faces many of the same problems, with dozens of those infected evading treatment, complicating efforts to trace cases. RED CROSS STAFF THREATENED The Red Cross in Guinea said it had been forced to temporarily suspend some operations in the country's southeast after staff working on Ebola were threatened. \"Locals wielding knives surrounded a marked Red Cross vehicle,\" a Red Cross official said, asking not to be named. The official said operations had been halted for safety reasons. The Red Cross later said only international staff were removed. A Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) center in Guinea was attacked by youths in April after staff were accused of bringing the disease into the country. Ebola causes fever, vomiting, bleeding and diarrhea and kills up to 90 percent of those it infects. Highly contagious, it is transmitted through contact with blood or other fluids. WHO has flagged three main factors driving its spread: the burial of victims in accordance with tradition, the dense populations around the capital cities of Guinea and Liberia and the bustling cross-border trade across the region. Health experts say the top priority must be containing Ebola with basic infection control measures such as vigilant handwashing and hygiene, and isolation of infected patients. Jeremy Farrar, a professor of tropical medicine and director of The Wellcome Trust, an influential global health charity, said people at high risk should also be offered experimental medicines, despite the drugs not having been fully tested. \"We have more than 450 deaths so far, and not a single individual has been offered anything beyond tepid sponging and 'we'll bury you nicely',\" Farrar told Reuters in an interview. \"It's just unacceptable.\"", "label": {"what": ["The outbreak has killed 467 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone since February", "West African health ministers meeting in Ghana", "with dozens of those infected evading treatment, complicating efforts to trace cases", "Locals wielding knives surrounded a marked Red Cross vehicle", "A Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) center in Guinea was attacked by youths", "We have more than 450 deaths so far, and not a single individual has been offered anything beyond tepid sponging and 'we'll bury you nicely'"], "when": ["on Wednesday", "since February", "on Wednesday", "in April", "so far"], "where": ["in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone", "in Ghana", "on the sidelines of the Accra meeting", "in the country's southeast"], "why": ["lack the resources", "deep cultural suspicions about the disease", "our biggest challenge is denial, fear and panic", "People are afraid but do not believe that the disease exists", "on Ebola were threatened", "safety reasons", "staff were accused of bringing the disease into the country", "the burial of victims in accordance with tradition", "the dense populations around the capital cities of Guinea and Liberia"], "who": ["West African states", "The outbreak", "ministers", "467 people", "the World Health Organization", "West African health ministers meeting", "Abubakarr Fofanah", "a country with one of the world's weakest health systems", "Sierra Leone", "President Ernest Bai Koroma", "his vice president", "all cabinet ministers", "Our people", "Bernice Dahn", "Liberia's deputy health minister", "Reuters", "Authorities", "dozens of those infected", "The Red Cross", "Locals", "a Red Cross official", "A Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) center", "the bustling cross-border trade across the region", "Health experts", "Jeremy Farrar", "a professor of tropical medicine and director of The Wellcome Trust", "an influential global health charity", "people at high risk", "a single individual"], "countermeasures": ["draw up a regional response", "appeals for cash", "warnings of the practices", "deputy health minister for Sierra Leone", "donate half of their salaries", "are trying to stop relatives of Ebola victims from giving them traditional funerals", "vigilant handwashing and hygiene", "isolation of infected patients", "people at high risk should also be offered experimental medicines"], "how": ["making it the largest and deadliest ever", "have allowed the disease to spread across borders and into cities", "cash was needed for drugs, basic protective gear and staff pay", "people get sick and the community members hide them and bury them", "which often involve the manual washing of the body, out of fear of spreading the infection", "The dead are instead meant to be buried by health staff wearing protective gear", "it had been forced to temporarily suspend some operations", "Ebola causes fever, vomiting, bleeding and diarrhea and kills up to 90 percent of those it infects", "Highly contagious", "it is transmitted through contact with blood or other fluids"]}}
{"text": "Accra (AFP) - The United Nations reassured west Africa on Wednesday that the world's deadliest-ever Ebola epidemic could be stopped in its tracks, telling the region's health ministers: \"We can handle this.\" The highly-contagious tropical bug has infected hundreds of people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, with the latest World Health Organization (WHO) figures showing confirmed or suspected cases had left 467 people dead. The new toll represented a rise of 129 -- or 38 percent -- since the UN agency's last bulletin given just a week ago. \"These kinds of outbreaks, these diseases, can be stopped,\" Keiji Fukuda, assistant director-general for health security at the WHO, told AFP, as 11 west African health ministers gathered for a two-day conference in Accra on combatting the killer pathogen. \"This is not a unique situation -- we have faced it many times -- so I'm quite confident that we can handle this. \"This is, however, the most complicated Ebola outbreak ever because it is spreading so fast in both urban and rural areas.\" Since the region's first ever epidemic of the deadly and highly contagious fever broke out in Guinea in January, the WHO has sent in more than 150 experts to help tackle the regional crisis. Despite the efforts of the UN agency and other health workers, there has been a \"significant increase\" in the rate of new cases and deaths in recent weeks, the organisation added. Medical charity Doctors Without Borders, known by its French initials MSF, said last week that the spread of the virus, which has had a mortality rate of up to 90 percent in previous outbreaks, was \"out of control\", with more than 60 outbreak hotspots. The WHO has warned that Ebola could spread to other countries, warning those hardest hit could struggle to contain the disease. The agency's top Ebola specialist Pierre Formenti told AFP last month that the recent surge in cases had come in part because efforts to contain the virus had been relaxed too quickly after the outbreak appeared to slow down in April. - Unstoppable bleeding - Ministers from Guinea, where 413 confirmed, suspected and probable cases have surfaced so far including 303 deaths, and Liberia, which has seen 107 cases and 65 deaths, are at the meeting. Sierra Leone, which has recorded 239 cases and 99 deaths, is also represented. In addition, officials from Ivory Coast, Mali, Senegal, Gambia and Guinea-Bissau, along with Ghana and countries as far afield as Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo are attending. They have been joined by a host of UN agencies and other aid organisations, including MSF and the Red Cross, as well as personnel from disease control centres in western Africa, the United States, Britain and the European Union. Health authorities have warned that people living in the forest areas straddling the three stricken countries often travel across their porous borders for trade, marriages and funerals, making containment of Ebola difficult. \"Most of the people living around these borders are very much connected in terms of ethnicity, trade and other social activities so you don't really differentiate these populations... and this gives it a very high possibility of spreading across borders to other countries,\" Adinoyi Ben Adeiza, of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, told AFP. Liberia's Deputy Health Minister Bernice Dahn told AFP relief efforts were also being hampered by a lack of awareness of the disease among traditional communities and stricken villages hiding victims. \"We need to galvanise the local leaders, the people believe their leaders better than us, the health workers... because there are a lot of traditional beliefs,\" she said. People don't even believe Ebola exists and that is helping to spread the disease.\" Meanwhile Sierra Leone's President Ernest Koroma said in a televised broadcast on Wednesday that anyone who \"harbours an Ebola victim without notifying health authorities\" was breaking the law and would be punished. The WHO has described the current Ebola epidemic as one of the most challenging since the virus was first identified in 1976 in what is now DR Congo. That outbreak -- the deadliest until this year -- killed 280 people, according to WHO figures. Ebola can fell its victims within days, causing severe fever and muscle pain, weakness, vomiting and diarrhoea -- in some cases shutting down organs and causing unstoppable bleeding.

{"text": "People at high risk of dying in West Africa's Ebola outbreak should be offered experimental medicines to see if they work, despite the drugs being not fully tested, the head of an influential global health charity said. Jeremy Farrar, a professor of tropical medicine and director of The Wellcome Trust charity, said Ebola's spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia is \"out of control\" and global health authorities should rethink the approach to potential treatments. \"We have more than 450 deaths so far - and not a single individual has been offered anything beyond tepid sponging and 'we'll bury you nicely',\" Farrar told Reuters in an interview. \"It's just unacceptable.\" The normal drug development process - of years of testing new drugs in animals, then in healthy human volunteers before they go to clinical trials in sick patients before being approved by regulators - takes too long and should not apply in rapidly spreading outbreaks of diseases like Ebola, he said. West Africa is battling its deadliest outbreak of Ebola, with 467 people killed so far by a disease that causes fever, vomiting, bleeding and diarrhoea, and can kill between 50 and 90 percent of those it infects. The World Health Organization (WHO) has called on other states in the region to prepare for the disease heading their way, and is co-hosting a meeting of West African health ministers in Ghana this week to try to strengthen the region's response. Farrar pointed to several experimental drugs and vaccines in development as potential treatments or preventative measures against Ebola, and questioned why they were not being tested in a situation where people at high risk might benefit. \"WOULD YOU TAKE IT?\" \"It's ridiculous that we haven't got these (experimental) products out of labs and animal trials and into human testing, and at least offered to people,\" he said. \"If you had a 60 percent chance of dying tomorrow, and there was something that had been tested in healthy volunteers (but not yet tried in patients or approved), would you take it?\" The pipeline of drugs being developed for Ebola is far from bulging - partly due to a lack of research money for a medicine which is likely to be needed mainly in poor countries with scant healthcare funds. But several small biotech companies and U.S. university departments are developing potential vaccines, and Tekmira Pharmaceuticals, which teamed up with the U.S. Department of Defense on an injectable drug for Ebola, started an initial Phase I trial in healthy volunteers in January. U.S.-based Inovio and privately held Vaxart are among those with experimental vaccines in animal testing, while GlaxoSmithKline last year acquired Swiss vaccine firm Okairos with an early-stage Ebola product. Farrar noted that while Ebola is a relatively rare disease, outbreaks have come regularly since the virus was first identified some 40 years ago, and can be predicted to happen in future - making testing potential drugs a sensible approach. \"This is not the first time this has happened, and it will happen again - we know that,\" he said. \"And we could all have pushed for having stockpiles (of experimental drugs) maybe held in Geneva, and they could have had WHO ethical approval, and then we'd be ready to go (when the next outbreak comes)\". TRADITIONAL BELIEFS, DENSE POPULATIONS The WHO said on Tuesday it believed three key factors were contributing to the spread of Ebola in the region. One was the burial of victims in accordance with cultural practices and traditional beliefs. Another was the dense population around the capital cities of Guinea and Liberia. The third was commercial and social activity along the borders of the three countries. Fear and mistrust are also driving dozens of victims to evade treatment, frustrating foreign and local doctors trying to contain the epidemic. Both the WHO and the charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), which has been heavily engaged in handling the outbreak on the ground, have said the top priority must be containing Ebola with basic but vital infection control measures such as vigilant hand washing and hygiene, and isolation of infected patients. Farrar acknowledged these were crucial, but said health organisations needed to consider experimental drugs in their planning for the future. \"There are candidate vaccines out there, and candidate drugs, and whilst I absolutely agree that the most important things are infection control and making sure people can't pass it on, ultimately you do have to move these things (candidate drugs) out and start offering them to people,\" he said. A University of Texas Medical Branch researcher, Thomas Giebert, told Reuters in March he was developing a potential Ebola vaccine, which had shown good results in animal tests and could, he said, be offered on \"compassionate grounds\" to people at risk in the current outbreak. But Ian Jones, a virologist at Britain's University of Reading, said calls for a vaccine were \"a knee-jerk response\". \"It's unclear if any vaccine could be delivered successfully to those at risk,\" he said. \"Instead, a strong public health message, increased medical support and cross border co-operation are the key actions required to reduce transmission and bring the outbreak to a close.\"", "label": {"what": ["People at high risk of dying in West Africa's Ebola outbreak should be offered experimental medicines to see if they work", "bola's spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia is 'out of control'", "We have more than 450 deaths so far", "West Africa is battling its deadliest outbreak of Ebola, with 467 people killed so far ", "The pipeline of drugs being developed for Ebola is far from bulging"], "when": ["so far", "this week", "tomorrow", "in January", "last year", "40 years ago", "in future", "on Tuesday", "in March"], "where": ["in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia", "in an interview", "other states in the region", "in Ghana", "in a situation where people at high risk might benefit", "out of labs", "in poor countries", "in Geneva", "in the region", "around the capital cities of Guinea and Liberia", "those at risk"], "why": ["takes too long", "by a disease", "prepare for the disease heading their way", "strengthen the region's response", "several experimental drugs and vaccines in development as potential treatments or preventative measures against Ebola", "we haven't got these (experimental) products out of labs and animal trials and into human testing, and at least offered to people", "partly due to a lack of research money for a medicine which is likely to be needed mainly in poor countries with scant healthcare funds", "Ebola is a relatively rare disease, outbreaks have come regularly since the virus was first identified some 40 years ago", "the burial of victims in accordance with cultural practices and traditional beliefs", "the dense population around the capital cities of Guinea and Liberia", "commercial and social activity along the borders of the three countries", "Fear and mistrust", "dozens of victims to evade treatment", "compassionate grounds", "reduce transmission and bring the outbreak to a close"], "who": ["People at high risk of dying in West Africa's Ebola outbreak", "the head of an influential global health charity said.

{"text": "Hundreds of West Africans could be carrying the deadly Ebola virus and not know it, potentially infecting hundreds more, as cash-strapped governments and overwhelmed aid agencies struggle to contain the virus's spread. At least 1,500 people have not yet been traced who are known to have come into contact with others confirmed or suspected to be infected with the haemorrhagic fever, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) told The Telegraph. Many more could be moving freely in the three countries battling the virus, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, but fear of the illness and mistrust of Western medicine means they refuse to come forward to speak to doctors. The current outbreak is the worst ever. So far 467 people have died and health staff have identified at least 292 other suspected or confirmed cases. Ebola is transmitted by coming into contact with bodily fluids of an infected person. It has no cure and as many as 90 per cent of its victims die, often from uncontrollable internal and external bleeding. Health authorities in Glasgow and organisers of the Commonwealth Games, which start in the city on July 23, said they were \"monitoring the situation on a daily basis\" because a team from Sierra Leone was coming to compete. \"Based on current advice from the World Health Organisation, we estimate the risk to the delegates from Sierra Leone is extremely low,\" the statement said. The outbreak was now \"out of control\" in the three affected countries and could quickly spread across West Africa, according to MSF, which is leading efforts to deal with cases. The virus's spread appeared to have been cut off in late April, when 74 people had died and Alpha Conde, Guinea's president, said the situation was \"well in hand\" and \"touch wood there won't be any new cases\". But a rare mix of highly mobile populations, mistrust of outsiders, a fear of being diagnosed and treated, traditional burial practices, and a lack of funding all mean Ebola flared again. The number of cases jumped by 129, or 38 per cent, in the week from June 25 to July 2, the WHO said. Health staff have even been attacked. The Red Cross in Guinea said it had been forced to temporarily suspend some operations in the country's southeast after staff working on Ebola were threatened on Wednesday. \"Locals wielding knives surrounded a marked Red Cross vehicle,\" a Red Cross official said, asking not to be named. An MSF centre elsewhere in Guinea was attacked in April by youths saying the charity brought Ebola into their country. \"I have covered six previous Ebola outbreaks and this is unprecedented,\" said Michel Van Herp, an epidemiologist with MSF in Belgium, who spent two months in the region in March and April and is returning again shortly. \"It is unique in terms of the number of cases, where they are and how they are spread, the difficulty of putting enough treatment centres where they are needed, and the fact that these people move about so much.\" MSF and other organisations including the British Red Cross are focused on treating those cases that come to their specialised isolation wards, but more needed to be done to reach out to the rest of the population, Mr Van Herp said. West African health ministers on Wednesday began a two-day emergency summit in Accra, the Ghanaian capital, to improve co-ordination of their responses to Ebola. Money was needed urgently for drugs, basic protective gear and staff pay, said Abubakarr Fofanah, Sierra Leone's deputy health minister. \"In Liberia, our biggest challenge is denial, fear and panic. Our people are very much afraid of the disease,\" Bernice Dahn, Liberia's deputy health minister, told Reuters on the sidelines of the Accra meeting. \"People are afraid but do not believe that the disease exists and because of that people get sick and the community members hide them and bury them, against all the norms we have put in place,\" she said.

The current outbreak is believed to have begun in Guinea at the beginning of 2014. The virus has since spread to neighbouring Sierra Leone and Liberia and has been declared the worst outbreak in history. Health ministers from 11 West African countries will meet in Ghana this Wednesday and Thursday to discuss the current crisis with WHO calling for \"drastic action\". \"Containment of this outbreak requires a strong response in the countries and especially along their shared border areas,\" said the United Nations organization.

Speaking at the Girl Summit C a major international conference in London designed to highlight the issues of FGM and child marriage C the home secretary, Theresa May, said the cross-party unit would help protect thousands of girls across the country. The unit, which could operate in a similar way to the government's forced marriage unit, has been a key demand of campaigners against FGM. \"These measures will ensure that we can maintain the momentum on stamping out these harmful practices,\" May said. The home secretary said the government would also strengthen laws around FGM, and would hold parents responsible if their child was a victim of the practice. May also announced a consultation into making it mandatory for professionals to report FGM and said victims going through court cases would be given lifelong anonymity. A push to improve police responses to FGM will see forces inspected on their response to honour-based violence, with a focus on FGM and forced marriage. The college of policing has also begun a consultation on new guidelines, which will urge officers to dismiss fears of being labelled racist when dealing with FGM. FGM has been illegal in the UK for three decades, but the first prosecution was only made in March and is currently going through the courts. May said that as part of a 1.4m FGM prevention programme, charities will receive funding to create community \"champions\" with the \"cultural knowledge and the connections necessary to challenge beliefs and behaviours\". \"We are making progress. Today we are taking one more step on the road towards giving women a voice and eradicating these harmful practices,\" she said.

{"text": "Parents will be prosecuted if they fail to prevent their daughter being cut, and all victims of female genital mutilation (FGM) will get lifelong anonymity, David Cameron will say on Tuesday. As the prime minister hosts a Girl Summit with Unicef aimed at mobilising domestic and international efforts to end FGM and child marriage, new measures will be announced aimed at ending the practices \"once and for all\". The announcement comes the day after it emerged that the number of women living in England and Wales who have been subjected to FGM is twice as high as previously thought. A new study reveals more than 137,000 women in England and Wales are living with the consequences of FGM. The number has significantly increased in the past 10 years as women flee war-torn countries to find safety in Britain, according to the report from City University and the human rights group Equality Now. To mark the first Girl Summit in the UK, the prime minister will announce a change to the law that will make it parents' responsibility to protect their daughters from FGM or face punishment. Currently it is against the law to cut a child in Britain or take a child out of the country for the purposes of FGM, but this new law will extend sanctions. Cameron will also launch a 1.4m \"prevent programme\" to help stop the practice being carried out on girls and to care for survivors, and he is expected to unveil new police guidance on how to handle new cases, and a consultation on civil orders to protect those at risk of FGM. A new specialist FGM service, which will include social services, will identify those at risk of being cut. Cameron will say: \"All girls have the right to live free from violence and coercion, without being forced into marriage, or the lifelong physical and psychological effects of female genital mutilation. Abhorrent practices like these, no matter how deeply rooted in societies, violate the rights of girls and women across the world, including here in the UK.\" The new study reveals that in England and Wales about 103,000 migrant women aged 15 to 49, 10,000 girls under 15 and about 24,000 women aged 50 or above had been subjected to FGM. The numbers of women from the Horn of Africa C where the most extreme form of FGM is common C had increased by 32,000, while the number of women from east and west Africa also increased by 10,000 over the past decade. A 2007 report using 2001 census data stated that 66,000 women and girls had been subjected to FGM in England and Wales with an estimated 24,000 girls under 15 at risk. Until now the most recent study, funded by the Trust for London and the Home Office, does not estimate the number of at-risk girls, but reveals 60,000 girls under 15 were born in England and Wales to mothers who had undergone FGM between 2001-11. Earlier this year, the then education secretary, Michael Gove, agreed to write to headteachers about the dangers of FGM after 250,000 people joined a campaign backed by the Guardian and change.org in the runup to the summer holidays when many girls are sent away to be cut. Efua Dorkenoo of Equality Now said the government had made positive steps but professionals needed clear guidance to identify at-risk girls and give them help. \"The government needs to get a handle over this extreme abuse of the most vulnerable girls in our society by implementing a robust national plan to address the issue,\" she said. \"There is no time to waste on platitudes as thousands of girls living in England and Wales are having their life blighted by this damaging practice.\" The World Health Organisation estimates that up to 140 million girls and women have been subjected to FGM, a cultural practice designed to curb female sexuality that involves the partial or whole removal of the outer sexual organs and can cause lifelong physical and psychological complications. The report states: \"A common-held belief in FGM-practising communities is that girls and women who have not undergone FGM have an insatiable sexual appetite, which has to be restrained to prevent bringing dishonour and shame to families.\" Measures to protect girls from FGM in the UK have also been announced by police and Border Force agents, who are stepping up operations as the school summer holidays begin. New Border Force child protection squads are joining with police to target specific flights in a bid to prevent vulnerable girls being taken out of the country for FGM. The beefed-up teams at major airports and border crossings in the UK are on alert for the start of the summer holidays, when experts say girls are at the highest risk of being taken out of the country. Specially trained Border Force agents will be working with police forces, which are also set to receive new advice stating that officers should put aside cultural sensitivities and fears of being branded racist in order to pursue investigations into FGM. In the first national guidance issued to all police across the country, the College of Policing warns officers not to let fears of being branded a racist stop them investigating FGM. As the summer holidays start, an 80-strong team of specialist officers at Heathrow, 65 at Gatwick and 21 at Manchester will be on the lookout for at-risk children. The port of Harwich also has a new team, while specialist FGM training is also planned at Birmingham, London City, Stansted, Calais and Dunkirk. Working with police intelligence, specific flights to countries which practise FGM C including Kenya, Ethiopia, Ghana, Nigeria, Dubai, Egypt and Turkey C will be targeted, said Ingrid Smith, assistant director of the Border Force at Gatwick. \"The message we are sending with this intensification of operations is that the practice of FGM will not be tolerated in this country,\" she said. \" Police, Border Force agents and social services will act together to stop this and people attempting to take children out of the country will be caught.\" James Brokenshire, the immigration and security minister, said border police were well-placed to gather intelligence on possible perpetrators and prevent FGM from being carried out. \"The school summer holidays are a time of particular risk for many girls,\" he said. \"Which is why we have teams of specially trained officers at major airports with the skills to identify and protect potential victims and stop the perpetrators.\" The guidance drawn up by the College of Policing is the first to deal with female genital mutilation and reflects growing public and political concern over the mutilation and the lack of prosecutions of individuals in the UK. Officers in England and Wales will be told that when investigating the mutilation of young girls in the UK they must consider all child protection measures, including removing a girl from her family if they believe she is at risk of FGM. Under section 46 of the Children Act 1989 police officers can decide to remove a child who they believe is at risk of \"significant harm\" to a place of safety for up to 72 hours. They can also apply to a court for an emergency protection order when they believe a child is in imminent danger. Officers will also be told that they should consider removal of younger sisters in a household where there are concerns that an older girl is at risk of FGM, because the younger siblings will also need protection. Chief Constable Alex Marshall, chief executive of the College of Policing, said: \"We want to ensure that officers have the best information possible to help them to protect the vulnerable and tackle this terrible crime. We must not let perceptions of cultural sensitivities get in the way of action against female genital mutilation. \"This guidance will help build our understanding and confidence in policing this crime so that we're better able to respond to victims' needs and ultimately bring perpetrators to justice.\" It warns officers not to be put off pursuing investigations because of the \"cultural sensitivities\" involved. \"Female genital mutilation is the deliberate cutting of the female genitalia. It is illegal, extremely painful and a form of violence against women and girls ... Officers must not avoid tackling FGM for fear of doing or saying the wrong thing or being considered racist.\" Female genital mutilation has been illegal in the UK since 1985, and the law was tightened in 2003 to make it an offence for a British resident to travel abroad in order to have FGM carried out on a child. Pressure has been growing on police and prosecutors over the failure C until earlier this year C to bring a single case to the British courts.

Cameron announced that parents in Britain would face prosecution for failing to prevent their daughters from being subjected to FGM, while setting out steps to tackle both practices in developing nations. \"Our aim is to outlaw FGM and child marriage everywhere for everyone,\" Cameron told the summit in London, to applause from an audience of experts and campaigners from around the world. FGM, which affects tens of millions of women, particularly in the Horn of Africa, ranges from removal of the clitoris to the mutilation and removal of other female genitalia. It can leave girls at risk of prolonged bleeding, infection, infertility and even death. Cameron acknowledged that ending FGM and child marriage was no easy task, saying they ranked alongside the global health threats of polio and tuberculosis in terms of the commitment needed to tackle them. But he argued: \"All girls have the right to live free from violence and coercion, without being forced into marriage or the lifelong physical and psychological effects of female genital mutilation. \"Abhorrent practices like these, no matter how deeply rooted in societies, violate the rights of girls and women across the world, including here in the UK.\" The summit, which is co-hosted by the United Nations Children's Fund, will produce an \"international charter\" calling for the eradication of FGM and child marriage within a generation.

{"text": "The ambitious pledge to end FGM comes from a UK summit dedicated to the topic, hosted by Prime Minister David Cameron. So what is FGM, and why is it still being carried out on millions of women and girls around the world? 'Cutting' Female genital mutilation (FGM) includes any procedure that alters or injures the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. Continue reading the main story In its most severe form, after removing the sensitive clitoris, the genitals are cut and stitched closed so that the woman cannot have or enjoy sex. A tiny piece of wood or reed is inserted to leave a small opening for the necessary flow of urine, and monthly blood when she comes of age (most FGM is carried out on infants or young girls before they reach puberty). When she is ready to have sex and a baby, she is \"unstitched\" - and then sewn back up again after to keep her what is described by proponents as \"hygienic, chaste and faithful\". In societies where FGM is commonplace, a woman can bring shame on herself and her family if she does not comply. Some see it as a religious necessity - though no scriptures explicitly prescribe it. Types of FGM Clitoridectomy - partial or total removal of the clitoris Excision - removal of the clitoris and inner labia (lips), with or without the outer labia Infibulation - cutting, removing and sewing up the genitalia Any other type of intentional damage to the female genitalia (burning, scraping et cetera) Most often, the procedure is carried out by traditional circumcisers or preachers, using crude, accessible tools, such as thorns and thread, broken glass or razor blades, and without anaesthetic. The pain is part of the centuries-old ritual - to prove that the woman is strong and can endure it. Corrosive substances may also be inserted into the vagina to scar, tighten and narrow it. But about a fifth of all FGM is now performed by healthcare workers in hospital settings - bespoke clinics that use scalpels and antiseptics - and the trend towards medicalisation is increasing, says the World Health Organization. Medicalisation This is partly to counter the argument that FGM is unsafe. A big risk with FGM is dangerous bleeding and infection. By doing it in a clinic, these risks can be minimised. Another compelling reason is money. Doctors and midwives in poor countries can boost their salary by selling their services. Efua Dorkenoo, senior FGM advisor at Equality Now, who has been campaigning for decades to put an end to FGM, said: \"In Egypt, around 70% of FGM is done by medical doctors. In Kenya and Nigeria, local midwives are cutting. \"The medical professionals, they think that if it can't be stopped it's best to do it in the medical setting. And some are doing it for money.\" And it's not just something that's done outside of the West. There have been numerous reports of the practice documented in the UK, even though it is illegal. While it is hard to get a handle on the true scale, figures suggest at least 4,000 women and girls have been treated for FGM in London's hospitals since 2009. As yet, there have been no convictions for these crimes. And it's something that's been going on quietly for decades, says Ms Dorkenoo. Unicef estimates that more than 130 million girls and women alive in the world today have undergone FGM, mostly for cultural, religious and social reasons, although support for FGM is falling. There are no health benefits, but many risks associated with FGM even when it is done in a hygienic setting. An obvious one is severe pain - both physical and psychological. Victims recall fighting to get free as they were held down and their legs forcibly spread for the cutting. Isa, who was cut when she was six, recalls: \"I can still remember the shouting. I can still remember the blood coming through. I can still remember the pain.\" She's since had surgery and, as a trained midwife, helps other women who have undergone FGM. Surgery may reverse some of the damage, but it cannot restore sensitive tissue that has been removed. Nor can it repair emotional scars. Janet Fyle, who is the Royal College of Midwives' lead advisor on FGM, says: \"Some women have flashbacks similar to soldiers who have been in battle. \"If they were kidnapped on their way to collect water or someone held them down, its a trauma to them psychologically and its very difficult to deal with those scars.\" She hopes that FGM will become a thing of the past. \"I have hopes that we will end it in a generation. At least here in the UK. \"The younger girls are more aware of it. We need to educate and empower them.\" But she says FGM is deeply embedded in many cultures - and that could take a long time to change. Efua Dorkenoo agrees: \"In the most bizarre way, women have become the perpetrators and practisers of this and keep the tradition going. If you speak to women, they may say they want it because it's linked to them being accepted by society. It's at the core of controlling a woman's sexuality. \"Because it's to do with sexuality, it's still very taboo to talk about.\" Mother-of-three Asseta was cut when she was seven years old. In Burkina Faso, where Asseta lives, more than 75% of girls and women have been cut. Asseta says: \"I was told there were some eggs to eat - so me and my friends rushed over. But when we got there, there was blood all over the floor from other girls. It was very difficult - being cut is an event I will never forget. \"Deciding not to get my daughters cut was a tough decision to make. \"Going against tradition can be difficult. First you need to convince yourself that the decision you're making is the best one - you need to know the facts in order to do that. \"I hope my daughter will have a better life, better health because of my decision. And I hope she will do the same for her daughters and avoid cutting.\" Asseta's daughter, 13-year-old Fatmata, says: \"I had heard about FGM and I've seen it happen - a friend of mine was cut when she was 12 years old. Seeing it happen made me feel scared.

{"text": "Pakistani schoolgirl activist Malala Yousafzai added her voice Tuesday to calls for an end to female genital mutilation, a procedure affecting millions of women and girls worldwide. A global \"Girl Summit\" is aimed at eradicating the practice, as well as child, early and forced marriage, within a generation. It's being held in London, hosted by the UK government along with U.N. children's agency UNICEF. UNICEF estimates that at least 125 million women and girls around the world have been subjected to FGM, the \"partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons.\" As many as 30 million girls under the age of 15 may still be at risk, UNICEF says, although the practice appears to be declining. FGM is concentrated in 29 countries, mostly in Africa, according to the agency. Generally done without anesthetic, it \"can have lifelong health consequences including chronic infection, severe pain during urination, menstruation, sexual intercourse, and childbirth, and psychological trauma,\" campaign group Equality Now states on its website. \"No one knows how many girls die from FGM.\" According to UNICEF, \"social acceptance\" is the most frequently cited reason for supporting the continuation of the practice. The summit -- the first of its kind and attended by representatives of governments, grass-roots organizations, campaigners and survivors from around the world -- aims to change people's ways of thinking. Malala said via Twitter: \"We should not be followers of traditions that go against human rights ... we are human beings and we make traditions.\" Alimatu Dimonekene, who underwent the procedure at the age of 16 in Sierra Leone and now campaigns against FGM, told the summit that while she was cut, her daughters never would be. In a video produced ahead of the conference with the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to C??]?cQ]?C?]?C?Xhildren, a UK children's charity, she told of the day her life was changed forever. \"I was 16. It was a nice warm day, normal day. There was no idea it was going to happen,\" she said. A room was already prepared for what is known in Sierra Leone as \"the cutting,\" she said. A friend of her mother's sat on her chest to try to keep her quiet, Dimonekene said, as she struggled against others who were pulling off her clothes and underwear. \"She came in with a knife and little blades in her hands,\" Dimonekene said of the woman who carried out the procedure, who had been hired by her grandmother. \"And a cloth was put in my mouth so I couldn't scream.\" She and a friend who was also cut were left alone in the room. \"For the next four days we were just crying, no one cleaned us up, we were still bleeding.\" The pain was just getting worse but she was unable to tell anyone, Dimonekene said. \"Physically, emotionally, it affected me terribly.\" Prime Minister David Cameron announced new UK government measures Tuesday to tackle the problem, a day after a major study revealed that an estimated 137,000 women are affected or at risk of FGM in England and Wales. The UK measures include legislation that will mean parents can be prosecuted if they fail to prevent their daughters being cut, as well as extra guidance for police and funding for support for survivors. \"I'll make reporting FGM mandatory for doctors, teachers and social workers. Let's end this abhorrent practice once and for all,\" Cameron said via Twitter. The new study, by City University London and campaign group Equality Now, is based on an examination of 2011 United Kingdom census data, in an effort to determine how many women and girls have moved to the country from places where the practice of mutilation is common. The last major report on the problem in England and Wales, in 2007, estimated that there were 66,000 women affected in the country and 24,000 at risk. The practice is illegal in the UK, but many girls are taken back to their parents' countries of ??]?cQ]?C?]?C?Xorigin for the procedure to be carried out.

Co-hosted by UNICEF and the UK Government the event is being held in London and brings together government representatives, international organisations, the private sector and girls themselves to call for action. Organisations involved say millions of girls and women are being prevented from achieving their potential, or live a life free from violence, because of harmful practices such as FGM and CEFM, which are illegal in the UK. Sky News spoke to one Kurdish woman who, at the age of 15, was forced to marry a man she didn't know, and was subsequently beaten and raped. Speaking through a translator, she described how her own relatives attacked her when she tried to escape. \"Her own family tried to kill her for leaving her husband,\" the translator said. \"They stabbed her twice, once in the chest and another in the back, and this was done by her brothers. \"When she did escape she was also prevented from seeing her children for 15 years. This has had a tremendous psychological effect.\" But Diane Nammi from the Iranian and Kurdish women's rights organisation says this isn't just a distant problem. \"It happens in London, in Newcastle, anywhere in the UK,\" she said. \"They are doing it mainly where there is sharia law and sharia courts, and so many young girls can be wife of a man as old as their father or grandfather, they can be the second wife of a man.\" It's estimated that 14 million girls are married every year before they reach 18, with one in nine across the developing world married by 15. Some 60% of child brides are also taken out of school so they have no formal education. In most countries the legal minimum age for marriage is 18 - but loopholes often allow it to happen as part of local customs. The group Girls Not Brides told Sky News that change is happening within communities and families in the UK, and across Africa, South Asia, the Middle East and Europe, with more and more saying no to this form of abuse. But Heather Hamilton from the partnership said many still don't realise the harm child marriage causes. She said: \"It's an entire end to the girl's life as her own person. \"We take it for granted that we're going to be able to make choices and have opportunities. \"We're going to be able to choose whether we get married, go to school or university. \"It's almost inconceivable for women who have the privileges we have to understand what this means, but it has a devastating impact on the girls and their lives.\" A social media campaign has been launched to boost support for the event, with the Government asking people to share the hashtag", "label": {"what": ["The first ever 'Girl Summit' is being held", "millions of girls and women are being prevented from achieving their potential, or live a life free from violence", "one Kurdish woman who, at the age of 15, was forced to marry a man she didn't know, and was subsequently beaten and raped", "so many young girls can be wife of a man as old as their father or grandfather", "they can be the second wife of a man", "many still don't realise the harm child marriage causes"], "when": ["at the age of 15", "for 15 years", "every year", "before they reach 18", "by 15"], "where": ["in the UK", "in London", "in Newcastle", "across the developing world", "across Africa", "South Asia", "the Middle East", "Europe"], "why": ["aimed at increasing efforts to end female genital mutilation (FGM) and child, early and forced marriage (CEFM) within a generation", "harmful practices such as FGM and CEFM, which are illegal in the UK", "there is sharia law and sharia courts", "loopholes often allow it to happen as part of local customs"], "who": ["UNICEF", "the UK Government", "government representatives", "international organisations", "the private sector", "girls", "Sky News", "one Kurdish woman", "Diane Nammi from the Iranian and Kurdish women's rights organisation", "Girls Not Brides", "Heather Hamilton"], "how": ["call for action", "Speaking through a translator", "her own relatives attacked her when she tried to escape", "They stabbed her twice, once in the chest and another in the back, and this was done by her brothers", "When she did escape she was also prevented from seeing her children for 15 years", "It's estimated that 14 million girls are married every year before they reach 18, with one in nine across the developing world married by 15", "Some 60% of child brides are also taken out of school so they have no formal education", "It's an entire end to the girl's life as her own person", "it has a devastating impact on the girls and their lives"], "countermeasures": ["change is happening within communities and families", "saying no to this form of abuse", "A social media campaign has been launched to boost support for the event, with the Government asking people to share the hashtag"]}}

Prime Minister David Cameron will announce new prosecution plans aimed at parents whose inaction leads to the abuse, as well as a 1.4million FGM Prevention Programme for survivors and those at risk. The new measures, which also target forced marriage, will be introduced at the Girl Summit, co-hosted by Unicef. \"All girls have the right to live free from violence and coercion, without being forced into marriage or the lifelong physical and psychological effects of female genital mutilation,\" Mr Cameron said. \"Abhorrent practices like these, no matter how deeply rooted in societies, violate the rights of girls and women across the world, including here in the UK. \"I want to build a better future for all our girls and I am hosting the Girl Summit today so that we say with one voice - let's end these practices once and for all.\" Under the plans, a dedicated \"FGM service\" will encompass social workers \"proactively\" identifying FGM cases, lifelong anonymity will be given to victims, and new police guidance will address how officers handle and investigate the issue. Unicef estimates that at least 125million girls and women have experience FGM in 29 countries within the Africa and Middle East, where it is most prevalent. It also says that as many as 30million girls under the age of 15 are still at risk of being subjected to FGM, despite the practice becoming less widespread. FGM, which is the partial or full removal of external female genitalia for non-medical reasons, can cause infections, infertility and in the most extreme cases, death. It is thought that roughly 27.2million girls and women in Egypt and 23.8million in Ethiopia have been subjected to the practice. Yesterday, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said compulsory training will also be given to teachers and doctors to help public sector workers identify actual or potential victims of FGM. It is thought that 137,000 women currently residing in England and Wales are estimated to have been subjected to FGM, after emigrating from their home countries. Current legislation says it is illegal to either perform FGM on a girl or woman in the UK, assist her in mutilating her own genitalia, or else assist a Briton or non-Briton abroad to have the procedure done overseas. Home Secretary Theresa May said: \"Today's summit aims to inspire and secure a better future for thousands of women and girls who are at risk of being seriously harmed by those closest to them C either by having their sexual, physical and mental health damaged by FGM or having their education, freedom and ambition curtailed when they are coerced into an unwanted marriage.\" The Girl Summit will be attended by over 500 delegates from 50 countries, Downing Street said, including United Nations agencies, charities, faith leaders and survivors.

{"text": "David Cameron has said female genital mutilation (FGM) and childhood forced marriage should be stopped worldwide \"within this generation\". Speaking at a global summit in London, the prime minister said Britain had no \"special magic\" to stop the practices - so global action was needed. Mr Cameron has also unveiled measures to tackle FGM in England and Wales. As part of this, parents will face prosecution if they fail to stop their daughters undergoing FGM. The domestic changes will not apply in Scotland or Northern Ireland, but governments there said they had their own plans to tackle FGM. 'Power of convening' Mr Cameron told the Girl Summit the existence of the practices were \"standing rebukes to our world\". \"It is absolutely clear about what we are trying to achieve,\" he said. \"It is such a simple but noble and good ambition and that is to outlaw the practices of female genital mutilation, and childhood and early forced marriage, to outlaw them everywhere for everyone within this generation.\" He said the summit was intended to use the \"power of convening people to come up with ideas and commitments to outlaw these practices\". Hosted by the UK government and children's charity Unicef, the summit is being attended by international politicians, campaigners including the Pakistani teenager Malala Yousafzai, and women who have undergone FGM. The summit is also looking at ways to end forced marriage. 'Big challenge' Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, executive director of UN Women, said the situation was improving but many girls remained at risk. \"The fact that 30 million girls are at risk of being cut in the coming years clearly means that we have a big challenge on our hands,\" she said.

It has been illegal across the UK since 1985, but the first prosecutions - which are currently ongoing - were not until this year. Government measures to tackle FGM in the UK (except Scotland) include: Training for teachers, doctors and social workers to identify and help girls at risk Lifelong anonymity for victims New guidance for police on handling FGM cases A 1.4 million prevention programme, in partnership with NHS England, to care for survivors and safeguard those at risk A new specialist FGM service which will include social services, to \"proactively identify and respond to FGM\" The Scottish government said it would \"carefully consider\" Mr Cameron's announcement to \"establish what steps could be applied\" to protect women and girls there. It said it was already working with the police, NHS and other organisations to ensure a \"comprehensive approach to FGM in Scotland\". Northern Ireland authorities said new guidelines on FGM had just been published, and work was being done to \"give effect to the guidelines and raise awareness of the issues\". An \"international charter\" calling for the eradication of FGM and forced marriage within a generation is also being unveiled, along with programmes to identify child and forced marriage in 12 developing countries. Home Secretary Theresa May, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and Justine Greening, the international development secretary, are also appearing at the summit. MPs recently said the UK's failure to tackle FGM was a \"national scandal\", and that failures by ministers, police and other agencies had led to the \"preventable mutilation of thousands of girls\". Analysis Jane Dreaper, BBC health correspondent Female genital mutilation has become a prominent issue in the UK in the past couple of years. No one knows for sure how many women and children here are affected. But ministers have underlined that it is a form of child abuse - and the UK should do all it can to prevent it. The prime minister is keen to demonstrate leadership on global issues beyond his increased spending on foreign aid, which has proved controversial at times. Today's summit aims to eradicate FGM and child or forced marriage within a generation. Is this doable? Summits like these sometimes fail to achieve their stated aims - but even when targets are not reached, there is still a sense of momentum and progress. And that could make a significant difference to the lives of thousands of girls worldwide. Unicef said 250 million women and girls alive today were married before the age of 15.

{"text": "Britain will introduce new laws to combat female genital mutilation (FGM) including making it compulsory for teachers and health workers to report cases, Prime Minister David Cameron said on Tuesday. The government, hosting a one-day London summit on FGM and forced marriage, also announced 1.4 million pounds (1.4 million pounds) of funding for an prevention programme and said it would enact legislation that would see parents prosecuted if they fail to prevent their daughter undergoing such a practice. \"It's absolutely clear what we are trying to achieve...and that is to outlaw the practices of female genital mutilation and childhood and early forced marriage; to outlaw them everywhere, for everyone, within this generation,\" Cameron said. He urged countries to sign up to an international charter, launched at the summit, which calls for the eradication of both practices and said 21 countries had already done so. FGM, the partial or total removal of external female genitalia, is a tradition practised widely in many African and Muslim countries and often justified as a means of suppressing a woman's sexual desire to prevent \"immoral\" behaviour. Around 103,000 women aged between 15 and 49, and another 10,000 girls aged under 15 who have migrated to England and Wales are estimated to have undergone FGM, according to a report on Tuesday from City University London. Worldwide, more than 130 million girls and women have undergone FGM and more than 700 million women alive today were children when they were married. Ministers and officials from Pakistan, Somalia, Ethiopia, India, Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Zambia and others also pledged to step up efforts to tackle both issues. But UNICEF warned that population growth, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, meant the number of FGM victims would soar and there would be no decline in the number of child brides unless global action was dramatically accelerated. Cameron said ending FGM and child marriage was a global challenge on a par with eradicating poverty and tackling diseases. \"We are dealing with a preventable evil. This does not need to happen,\" he told the summit attended by more than 500 delegates from 50 countries. Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani schoolgirl and girl's rights campaigner who was shot in the head by the Taliban in 2012, said getting girls into school was the best way to fight child marriage and FGM.

The Girl Summit, co-hosted by the UK Government and UNICEF, will focus on tackling violence against women in the UK, and internationally. Home secretary Theresa May will lead the summit with International development secretary Justine Greening, alongside heads of state, survivors and charities. In England and Wales, an estimated 66,000 women are living with the consequences of FGM/C C an illegal cultural practice where girls' genitalia are cut - with more than 20,000 at risk each year. UN figures estimate that 125 million women and girls worldwide have been cut C and that at least 30 million more will be at risk over the next decade. The UK Government will tomorrow announce measures on how we can change this here in Britain and globally, as well as releasing new figures. It follows announcements, made by Cameron, that forced marriage and FGM/C would be \"at the top of Britain's aid agenda\" and that efforts would be made to tackle it here in the UK. He stated his aim to end both practices \"within a generation.\" As part of the summit, the Government is asking people to pledge their support through social media. It already has 5,566 pledges which are being shared on Twitter with the hashtag #GirlSummit. Supporters include Mia Farrow, Jon Snow, Desmond Tutu and David Miliband. An Instagram film has also been created in support of those girls and young women affected by FGM/C and forced child marriage around the world. Called Freedom Is it is made up of Instagram footage, crowd-sourced from hundreds of submissions sent in, from across the world. Last year, the Department for International Development launched a 35 million programme that will work in 17 countries to support the Africa-led movement to end FGM/C. Justine Greening said: \"It's fantastic to see so many people coming together to show their support for girls. \"There are too many girls around the world who are being denied the freedom to control their bodies and their futures. \"The Girl Summit is helping to drive momentum towards this unique opportunity that we have to end harmful practices such as FGM and child marriage within a generation.\"", "label": {"what": ["hosting Britain's first Girl Summit", "co-hosted by the UK Government and UNICEF", "66,000 women are living with the consequences of FGM/C", "125 million women and girls worldwide have been cut C", "releasing new figures", "stated his aim to end both practices", "It already has 5,566 pledges", "An Instagram film has also been created", "being denied the freedom to control their bodies and their futures"], "when": ["tomorrow", "each year", "over the next decade", "Last year", "within a generation"], "where": ["in the UK", "In England and Wales", "on Twitter", "from across the world", "in 17 countries"], "why": ["to end female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) and child/forced marriages", "in support of those girls and young women affected by FGM/C and forced child marriage around the world", "to support the Africa-led movement to end FGM/C"], "who": ["David Cameron", "Home secretary Theresa May", "International development secretary Justine Greening", "heads of state, survivors and charities", "30 million more", "The UK Government", "Supporters include Mia Farrow, Jon Snow, Desmond Tutu and David Miliband", "UN"], "how": ["focus on tackling violence against women", "asking people to pledge their support through social media", "with the hashtag #GirlSummit", "crowd-sourced from hundreds of submissions sent in"], "countermeasures": ["announce measures on how we can change this", "efforts would be made to tackle it", "the Department for International Development launched a 35 million programme", "many people coming together to show their support for girls", "The Girl Summit"]}}
{"text": "An American doctor is receiving intensive medical treatment in Liberia after he was infected with the deadly Ebola virus while treating patients in the West African nation, a spokeswoman for an aid organisation said on Sunday. Dr Kent Brantly was in stable condition, talking with his doctors and working on his computer while receiving care at a hospital in the Liberian capital of Monrovia, said Melissa Strickland, a spokeswoman for North Carolina-based Samaritan's Purse. Strickland cautioned that Brantly is \"not out of the woods yet\". She said patients have a better chance of survival if they receive treatment immediately after being infected, which Brantly did. Brantly, 33, has been working with Samaritan's Purse in Liberia since October 2013 as part of the group's post-residency programme for doctors, Strickland said. He is the medical director for the aid organisation's case management centre in the city. The website for Samaritan's Purse said Brantly had worked as a family practice physician in Fort Worth, Texas. The highly contagious Ebola virus is one of the most deadly diseases in the world. Photos of Brantly working in Liberia show him in white coveralls made of a synthetic material that he wore for hours a day while treating Ebola patients. Brantly was quoted in a posting on the organisation's website earlier this year about efforts to maintain an isolation ward for patients. \"The hospital is taking great effort to be prepared,\" Brantly said. \"In past Ebola outbreaks, many of the casualties have been healthcare workers who contracted the disease through their work caring for infected individuals.\" Strickland says that Brantly's wife and children had been living with him in Africa, but they are currently in the US. A woman who identified herself as Brantly's mother answered a US phone listing for him, but said family members are declining comment at this time. The deadly disease has killed at least 672 people in several African countries since the outbreak began earlier this year. A government official said on Sunday that one of Liberia's most high-profile doctors has died of Ebola, highlighting the risks facing health workers trying to combat the deadly disease. Dr Samuel Brisbane is the first Liberian doctor to die in an outbreak the World Health Organisation says has killed 129 people in the West African nation. A Ugandan doctor working in the country died earlier this month. Last week a Liberian man died of Ebola in the Nigerian city of Lagos, the first confirmed case in Africa's biggest city of 21 million people. Nigerian health authorities, anxious to stop the spread of the disease, are concerned that the sick man had boarded an international flight. Officials in Togo, where the sick man's flight had a stopover, also went on high alert after learning that Ebola could possibly have spread to a fifth country. An Ebola outbreak in Lagos, where many live in cramped conditions, could be a disaster. Nigerian newspapers describe the effort as a \"scramble\" to contain the threat after the Liberian arrived in Lagos and then died on Friday. International airports in Nigeria are screening passengers arriving from foreign countries for symptoms of Ebola, said Yakubu Dati, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Authority of Nigeria. Airports in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the three other West African countries affected by the outbreak, have implemented some preventive measures, according to officials in those countries. But none of the safeguards is foolproof. Doctors say health screens could be effective, but Ebola has a variable incubation period of between two and 21 days and cannot be diagnosed on the spot. Patrick Sawyer, a consultant for the Liberian ministry of finance, arrived in Nigeria on Tuesday and was immediately detained by health authorities suspecting he might have Ebola. Authorities announced on Friday that blood tests from the Lagos University teaching hospital confirmed Sawyer died of Ebola earlier that day. Sawyer reportedly did not show Ebola symptoms when he boarded the plane. Nearly 50 other passengers on the flight are being monitored for signs of Ebola but are not being kept in isolation, said an employee at Nigeria's ministry of health, who insisted on anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media. Sawyer's sister also died of Ebola in Liberia, according to Liberian officials, but Sawyer claimed to have had no contact with her. Ebola is highly contagious and kills more than 70% of people infected. It is passed by touching bodily fluids of patients even after they die.", "label": {"what": ["An American doctor is receiving intensive medical treatment in Liberia", "he was infected with the deadly Ebola virus", "talking with his doctors and working on his computer", "receiving care", "The hospital is taking great effort to be prepared", "The deadly disease has killed at least 672 people in several African countries", "the outbreak began earlier this year", "one of Liberia's most high-profile doctors has died of Ebola", "has killed 129 people in the West African nation", "Last week a Liberian man died of Ebola in the Nigerian city of Lagos", "the sick man had boarded an international flight", "went on high alert", "the Liberian arrived in Lagos and then died on Friday", "International airports in Nigeria are screening passengers arriving from foreign countries for symptoms of Ebola", "are not being kept in isolation", "the three other West African countries affected by the outbreak", "arrived in Nigeria on Tuesday", "was immediately detained by health authorities", "Authorities announced on Friday that blood tests from the Lagos University teaching hospital confirmed Sawyer died of Ebola earlier that day", "Nearly 50 other passengers on the flight are being monitored", "Sawyer's sister also died of Ebola in Liberia", "kills more than 70% of people infected"], "when": ["on Sunday", "Last week", "on Friday", "since October 2013", "on Tuesday", "for hours a day", "earlier this year", "earlier this month"], "where": ["in the West African nation", "at a hospital in the Liberian capital of Monrovia", "in Fort Worth, Texas", "in Africa", "in the US", "in Lagos", "in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone"], "why": ["through their work caring for infected individuals", "learning that Ebola could possibly have spread to a fifth country", "suspecting he might have Ebola", "for signs of Ebola", "because he was not authorised to speak to the media"], "who": ["patients", "a spokeswoman for an aid organisation", "Dr Kent Brantly", "Melissa Strickland", "a spokeswoman for North Carolina-based Samaritan's Purse", "a family practice physician", "healthcare workers", "Brantly's mother", "family members", "Dr Samuel Brisbane", "the first Liberian doctor", "the World Health Organisation", "A Ugandan doctor working in the country", "21 million people", "Nigerian health authorities", "Officials in Togo", "Nigerian newspapers", "Yakubu Dati, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Authority of Nigeria", "officials in those countries", "Patrick Sawyer, a consultant for the Liberian ministry of finance", "an employee at Nigeria's ministry of health"], "how": ["highly contagious", "one of the most deadly diseases in the world", "a variable incubation period of between two and 21 days", "cannot be diagnosed on the spot", "by touching bodily fluids of patients even after they die"], "countermeasures": ["patients have a better chance of survival if they receive treatment immediately after being infected", "efforts to maintain an isolation ward for patients", "have implemented some preventive measures"]}}
{"text": "A Texas doctor who had moved to Liberia to work for a medical charity has been infected with the deadly virus ebola. Dr Kent Brantly, who moved to the country before the outbreak, is now being treated for the disease at a Liberia hospital as news that one of the West African nation's most respected physicians has died from the virus. A government official confirmed that Dr Samuel Brisbane, chief medical doctor at the country's largest hospital, passed away Saturday in the largest outbreak of ebola. Ebola, one of the world's deadliest viruses, has been spreading through West Africa, with the latest case being confirmed in Nigeria after an infected businessman traveled there by plane. Dr Brantly, medical director for the North Carolina-based company Samaritan's Purse, had been part of a team working in grueling conditions at an ebola ward in Monrovia. The married father-of-two had to wear a special suit to protect him from the highly contagious disease, while working in an isolation unit in the stifling African heat. Although his family had been living in Liberia with him, a spokesperson for Samaritan's Purse said they were in the U.S. when he fell ill. The 33-year-old joined the Christian international relief organization after finishing his medical residency at John Peter Smith Hospital, in Forth Worth. President of the Texas hospital, Robert Earley, said staff were shocked and saddened by the news, as he praised Dr Brantly's dedication to help others. 'This is the kind of individual that he is. They go into the worst situations in the world and try to save lives,' he told WFAA. Colleagues at Samaritan's Purse said the agency was doing everything in its power to get Dr Brantly the best possible care. Symptoms of ebola mimic other common illnesses such as malaria in the early stages. But the disease is passed on quickly through blood, bodily fluids or infected tissues in people or animals. With only a 10 percent chance of survival, the disease has a devastating impact on communities. The most recent outbreak, which began earlier this year, has already killed 672 people in at least four countries. And on Sunday, a Liberian government official confirmed that Dr Brisbane had become the virus's latest victim. Dr Brisbane, Chief Medical Doctor at John F Kennedy Memorial Medical Center in Monrovia, died Saturday after contracting the disease. He is the first Liberian doctor to die in the oubreak. After falling ill with Ebola, he was taken to a treatment center on the outskirts of the capital, where he died, said Tolbert Nyenswah, an assistant health minister. Under the supervision of health workers, family members escorted the doctor's body to a burial location west of the city, Nyenswah said. He added that another doctor who had been working in Liberia's central Bong County was also being treated for Ebola at the same center where Brisbane died. The situation ''is getting more and more scary,'' Nyenswah said. In a worrying development, an airline passenger traveling from Liberia to Nigeria, via Togo, died from the disease after arriving in Lagos. Patrick Sawyer, a consultant for the Liberian Ministry of Finance, arrived in Nigeria on Tuesday and was immediately detained by health authorities suspecting he might have ebola, Plyler said. Authorities announced Friday that blood tests from the Lagos University Teaching Hospital confirmed Sawyer died of ebola earlier that day. An outbreak in Lagos, Africa's megacity where many live in cramped conditions, could be a major diisaster. 'Lagos is completely different from other cities because we're talking about millions of people,' Dr Unni Krishnan, of Plan International's Disaster Response and Preparedness, said. Nigerian newspapers described the effort to contain the outbreak as a 'scramble'  after Sawyer arrived in Lagos for an international conference, and then died Friday. International airports in the country are screening passengers arriving from foreign countries for symptoms, Yakubu Dati, spokesman for Federal Aviation Authority of Nigeria, said. Airports have also set up holding rooms in case another potential Ebola victim lands in Nigeria. The ease at which a traveler, who could be infected, can move on international flights from Liberia has concerned health organizations. It has raised fears that other passengers could unwittingly contribute to the spread of the disease. Officials in Togo, where Sawyer passed through, have been on high alert since the latest case was confirmed. Dr Lance Plyler, who leads the ebola medical efforts in Liberia that Dr Brantly was part of, said screening airline passengers may help slow the spread of the disease, but it couldn't prevent it. 'Unfortunately the initial signs of ebola imitate other diseases, like malaria or typhoid,' he said. Airports in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the three other West African countries affected by the current outbreak, have implemented some preventive measures, according to officials in those countries. But none of the safeguards are foolproof, health experts warned. Ebola has a variable incubation period of between two and 21 days and cannot be diagnosed on the spot. Sawyer reportedly did not show ebola symptoms when he boarded the plane, Plyler said, but by the time he arrived in Nigeria he was vomiting and had diarrhea. There has not been another recently recorded case of Ebola spreading through air travel, he added. Nearly 50 other passengers on the flight are being monitored for signs of Ebola but are not being kept in isolation, said an employee at Nigeria's Ministry of Health, who insisted on anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press. Sawyer's sister also died of ebola in Liberia, according to officials, but he claimed to have had no contact with her. Ebola is passed by touching bodily fluids of patients even after they die, he said. Traditional burials that include rubbing the bodies of the dead contribute to the spread of the disease, Dr Krishnan added. There is no 'magic bullet' cure for ebola, but early detection and treatment of fluids and nutrition can be effective. Quickly isolating patients is also crucial in slowing the spread of the disease.", "label": {"what": ["moved to Liberia to work for a medical charity", "has been infected with the deadly virus ebola", "being treated for the disease", "one of the West African nation's most respected physicians has died from the virus", "passed away Saturday in the largest outbreak of ebola", "joined the Christian international relief organization", "staff were shocked and saddened by the news", "began earlier this year, has already killed 672 people in at least four countries", "Dr Brisbane had become the virus's latest victim", "the first Liberian doctor to die in the oubreak", "falling ill with Ebola", "family members escorted the doctor's body to a burial location west of the city", "another doctor who had been working in Liberia's central Bong County was also being treated for Ebola at the same center", "an airline passenger traveling from Liberia to Nigeria, via Togo, died from the disease after arriving in Lagos", "was immediately detained by health authorities", "blood tests from the Lagos University Teaching Hospital confirmed Sawyer died of ebola", "screening passengers arriving from foreign countries for symptoms", "Sawyer arrived in Lagos for an international conference, and then died Friday", "It has raised fears that other passengers could unwittingly contribute to the spread of the disease", "have been on high alert since the latest case was confirmed", "the three other West African countries affected by the current outbreak", "Sawyer reportedly did not show ebola symptoms when he boarded the plane", "by the time he arrived in Nigeria he was vomiting and had diarrhea", "Nearly 50 other passengers on the flight are being monitored for signs of Ebola", "not being kept in isolation", "Sawyer's sister also died of ebola in Liberia"], "when": ["on Sunday", "Saturday", "on Tuesday", "Friday", "earlier that day"], "where": ["at a Liberia hospital", "in Nigeria", "at an ebola ward in Monrovia", "in an isolation unit in the stifling African heat", "in the U.S.", "at John Peter Smith Hospital, in Forth Worth", "in Lagos"], "why": ["suspecting he might have ebola", "because we're talking about millions of people", "because he was not authorized to speak to the press"], "who": ["A Texas doctor", "Dr Kent Brantly", "Dr Samuel Brisbane, chief medical doctor at the country's largest hospital", "an infected businessman", "medical director for the North Carolina-based company Samaritan's Purse", "a spokesperson for Samaritan's Purse", "The 33-year-old", "President of the Texas hospital, Robert Earley", "WFAA", "Colleagues at Samaritan's Purse", "a Liberian government official", "Chief Medical Doctor at John F Kennedy Memorial Medical Center in Monrovia", "Tolbert Nyenswah, an assistant health minister", "Patrick Sawyer, a consultant for the Liberian Ministry of Finance", "Dr Unni Krishnan, of Plan International's Disaster Response and Preparedness", "Nigerian newspapers", "Yakubu Dati, spokesman for Federal Aviation Authority of Nigeria", "Officials in Togo", "Dr Lance Plyler", "Airports in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone", "health experts", "an employee at Nigeria's Ministry of Health"], "how": ["one of the world's deadliest viruses", "spreading through West Africa", "wear a special suit to protect him from the highly contagious disease", "Symptoms of ebola mimic other common illnesses such as malaria in the early stages", "the disease is passed on quickly through blood, bodily fluids or infected tissues in people or animals", "10 percent chance of survival", "the disease has a devastating impact on communities", "the initial signs of ebola imitate other diseases, like malaria or typhoid", "a variable incubation period of between two and 21 days", "cannot be diagnosed on the spot", "spreading through air travel", "by touching bodily fluids of patients even after they die"], "countermeasures": ["the agency was doing everything in its power to get Dr Brantly the best possible care", "he was taken to a treatment center on the outskirts of the capital", "Airports have also set up holding rooms", "screening airline passengers", "have implemented some preventive measures", "early detection and treatment of fluids and nutrition can be effective", "Quickly isolating patients is also crucial in slowing the spread of the disease"]}}
{"text": "One of Liberia's most high-profile doctors has died of Ebola, a government official said on Sunday, and a second US healthcare worker has been infected in what the World Health Organisation (WHO) is calling the largest outbreak ever recorded of the disease. Dr Samuel Brisbane is the first Liberian doctor to die in an outbreak, which the WHO says has killed 129 people in the west African nation. A Ugandan doctor working in the country died this month. Brisbane, who once served as a medical adviser to the former Liberian president, Charles Taylor, was working as a consultant with the internal medicine unit at the country's largest hospital, the John F Kennedy Memorial Medical Center in Monrovia. After falling ill, he was taken to a treatment centre on the outskirts of the capital, where he died, said Tolbert Nyenswah, an assistant health minister.Under the supervision of health workers, family members escorted the doctor's body to a burial location west of the city, Nyenswah said. He said another doctor who had been working in Liberia's central Bong County was being treated for Ebola at the centre where Brisbane died. The situation \"is getting more and more scary,\" Nyenswah said. Last week Sierra Leone's top Ebola doctor fell ill with the disease and in Liberia, Samaritan's Purse, a Christian charity, announced at the weekend that an American doctor was infected. Dr Kent Brantly had been isolated at the group's Ebola treatment centre at the ELWA hospital in the Liberian capital, Monrovia. A second American, Nancy Writebol, later tested positive for the virus at the same medical compound, said Ken Isaacs, of Samaritan's Purse. Isaacs said Writebol, who works with the allied aid group SIM, was in a stable but serious condition at a hospital near Monrovia. Brantly received intensive treatment on Sunday and was talking to his medical team and working on his computer, said Melissa Strickland, a spokeswoman for Samaritan's Purse. \"We are hopeful, but he is certainly not out of the woods yet,\" Strickland said. In Nigeria, officials announced on Friday that a Liberian official had died of Ebola after flying from Monrovia to Lagos raising fears that other passengers could take the disease beyond Africa. The WHO says the outbreak has also killed 319 people in Guinea and 224 in Sierra Leone. Liberia's president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, used her Independence Day address to discuss a new taskforce to combat Ebola. Information minister, Lewis Brown, said: \"It will go from community to community, from village to village, from town to town in order to increase awareness.\" There is no known cure for Ebola, which begins with symptoms including fever and sore throat but then escalates to vomiting, diarrhoea and internal and external bleeding. Experts believe the west African outbreak could have begun in January in south-east Guinea, though the first cases were not confirmed until March.

{"text": "Two U.S. citizens are being treated for Ebola in Liberia and the country shut some border crossings, as the worst outbreak of the disease on record spread to Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation and largest economy. Kent Brantly, the medical director of the Samaritan's Purse Ebola center in the Liberian capital Monrovia, is in isolation and receiving treatment, the Boone, North Carolina-based charity said in a statement on its website yesterday. Nancy Writebol, who was helping the team treating patients at the center, has also tested positive for Ebola, the group said. Ebola, which has no known cure or treatment and leads to death in as many as 90 percent of those who get it, has killed more than 660 people in four West African nations since March, the worst outbreak since the virus was first reported in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1976. Nigeria reported its first case last week after an infected Liberian man landed in Lagos, Africa's largest city. Protecting Against the Ebola Virus \"He could have gone anywhere\" on a flight, said Ben Neuman, a virologist at the University of Reading in the U.K. \"As this epidemic goes on, this sort of thing is eventually probably going to happen.\" Still, the chances of the virus spreading by air travel outside of Africa is small, Neuman said. \"If you look at the numbers, there are probably about 300 people who are currently infected with Ebola virus, and most of those would be too ill to sit up or walk,\" Neuman said by phone today. \"So the odds are small, but it is something that needs to be watched.\" Swiss Woman Only one case has ever been reported of an Ebola infection being exported outside Africa, according to David Heymann, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. In 1994, in a 34-year-old Swiss woman was infected in Ivory Coast while performing an autopsy on a dead chimpanzee. She was repatriated to Switzerland and recovered without infecting anyone else. Liberia shut all minor border crossings to contain the virus, AllAfrica.com reported, citing a government statement. The country plans to establish testing centers at major entry points that remain open, including Roberts International Airport, James Spriggs Payne Airport, Foya Crossing, Bo Waterside Crossing, and Ganta Crossing, according to AllAfrica.com. Nigeria's Arik Air is suspending flights to Monrovia in Liberia and the Sierra Leone capital of Freetown because of the Ebola outbreak, ThisDay newspaper reported, citing a statement from the airline. Wild Animals Ebola virus is transmitted to people through the blood and other secretions of wild animals, such as chimpanzees, gorillas and bats, according to the World Health Organization. Humans spread it to each other through contact with bodily fluids of infected people. It causes fever, diarrhea and vomiting, and can lead to bleeding from the eyes, ears and nose. The virus isn't transmitted through the air, and can only be transmitted in sweat by patients who are in the late stages of the disease, so there's no risk the passenger in Nigeria infected other travelers on the plane unless he vomited or they somehow came into contact with his bodily secretions, Neuman said. \"You wouldn't expect to catch it even if you're sitting next to someone,\" he said. \"If they're well enough to get on the plane, they should be well enough not to infect you, probably.\" Medical staff are at the highest risk of contracting the virus through bodily secretions such as blood and sweat because of their proximity to patients. Gloves  and  Gowns Health workers attending to the patient should have been wearing gloves, gowns and face visors to prevent contact between the patient's bodily fluids and their own mucus membranes, such as the eyes, mouth, nose and ears, said Heymann, who has studied Ebola since the 1976 outbreak. \"People who have been in contact should be under fever surveillance, they should have their temperature taken twice a day and if they became febrile they should be immediately isolated,\" H?h????????eymann said by phone from London yesterday. A confirmatory test from the Nigerian case is being sent to Dakar in Senegal, said Tarik Jasarevic, a WHO spokesman. The Geneva-based WHO is sending disease-trackers to Lagos, including a specialist in burial practices to make sure the risk of further transmission is limited, he said. \"Every time there is an infection in a new location it is a serious development, but the principle remains the same,\" Jasarevic said by phone from Sierra Leone. \"You have to identify this person, test them, identify the contacts and follow them for 21 days.\" Denial and Hostility Denial the disease exists, hostility to medical workers, a lack of medical supplies and below-standard hygiene are complicating efforts to contain the spread of the disease. In Sierra Leone, victims' families have attacked doctors, while in neighboring Liberia the husband of a victim tried to burn the hospital down where his wife died.

{"text": "Nigerian health authorities are racing to stop the spread of Ebola after a man brought the deadly and highly contagious disease by plane to Lagos, Africa's largest city with 21 million people. The fact that the traveller from Liberia could board an international flight also raised new fears that other passengers could take the disease beyond Africa due to weak inspection of passengers and the fact Ebola's symptoms are similar to other diseases. Ebola outbreak: Liberian man dies in quarantine in Nigeria Ebola outbreak death toll jumps to 603, WHO says Ebola-sickened travellers may cross borders, WHO warns Officials in the country of Togo, where the sick man's flight had a stopover, also went on high alert after learning Ebola could possibly have spread to a fifth country. Screening people as they enter the country may help slow the spread of the disease, but it is no guarantee Ebola won't travel by airplane, according to Dr. Lance Plyler, who heads Ebola medical efforts in Liberia for aid organization Samaritan's Purse. \"Unfortunately the initial signs of Ebola imitate other diseases, like malaria or typhoid,\" he said. The aid organization on Saturday said an American doctor working with Ebola patients in Liberia had tested positive for the deadly virus. A Samaritan's Purse news release said Dr. Kent Brantly was being treated at a hospital in Monrovia, the capital. Ebola already had caused some 672 deaths across a wide swath of West Africa before the Nigeria case was announced. It is the deadliest outbreak on record for Ebola, and now it threatens Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation. An outbreak in Lagos, Africa's megacity where many live in cramped conditions, could be a major diisaster. \"Lagos is completely different from other cities because we're talking about millions of people,\" said Plan International's Disaster Response and Preparedness Head, Dr. Unni Krishnan. Nigerian newspapers describe the effort as a \"scramble\" to contain the threat after the Liberian arrived in Lagos and then died Friday. Passengers screened for virus International airports in Nigeria are screening passengers arriving from foreign countries for symptoms of Ebola, according to Yakubu Dati, the spokesman for Federal Aviation Authority of Nigeria. Health officials are also working with ports and land borders, he said. \"They are giving out information in terms of enlightenment, what to do, what to look out for.\" Nigerian airports are setting up holding rooms to ready in case another potential Ebola victim lands in Nigeria. Airports in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the three other West African countries affected by the current Ebola outbreak, have implemented some preventive measures, according to officials in those countries. But none of the safeguards are foolproof, say health experts. Variable incubation period Doctors say health screens could be effective, but Ebola has a variable incubation period of between two and 21 days and cannot be diagnosed on the spot. Patrick Sawyer, a consultant for the Liberian Ministry of Finance arrived in Nigeria on Tuesday and was immediately detained by health authorities suspecting he might have Ebola, Plyler said. On his way to Lagos, Sawyer's plane also stopped in Lome, Togo, according to the World Health Organization. Authorities announced Friday that blood tests from the Lagos University Teaching Hospital confirmed Sawyer died of Ebola earlier that day. Sawyer reportedly did not show Ebola symptoms when he boarded the plane, Plyler said, but by the time he arrived in Nigeria he was vomiting and had diarrhea. There has not been another recently recorded case of Ebola spreading through air travel, he added. Nearly 50 other passengers on the flight are being monitored for signs of Ebola but are not being kept in isolation, said an employee at Nigeria's Ministry of Health, who insisted on anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press. Sawyer's sister also died of Ebola in Liberia, according to Liberian officials, but he claimed to have had no contact with her. Ebola is highly contagious and kills more than 70 per cent of people infected. Traditional burials spread disease Ebola is passed by touching bodily fluids of patients even after they die, he said. Traditional burials that include rubbing the bodies of the dead contribute to the spread of the disease, Krishnan added. There is no \"magic bullet\" cure for Ebola, but early detection and treatment of fluids and nutrition can be effective, said Plyler in Liberia. Quickly isolating patients who show symptoms is also crucial in slowing the spread of the disease. West African hospital systems have weak and \"often paralyzed\" health care systems, he added, and are not usually equipped to handle Ebola outbreaks. International aid organizations like his and Doctors Without Borders have stepped in, but they also lack enough funding and manpower. \"We need more humanitarian workers,\" he said. \"We need resources.\"", "label": {"what": ["Nigerian health authorities are racing to stop the spread of Ebola", "The fact that the traveller from Liberia could board an international flight also raised new

The medic, who is married and has children, is being treated at a hospital in the capital Monrovia. Another US citizen has also been infected with the virus, according to the Samaritan's Purse aid organisation, for which Dr Brantly works. Nancy Writebol is not employed by Samaritan's Purse, its spokesman told Sky News, but was working with their staff in a Monrovia hospital. She had been working as a hygienist who decontaminated those entering and leaving the hospital's Ebola care area. \"It's been a shock to everyone on our team to have two of our players get pounded with the disease,\" said Ken Isaacs, a spokesman for North Carolina-based Samaritan's Purse. Dr Brantly has body aches and fever but is in a stable condition. Mr Isaacs told Sky News the doctor is \"not out of the woods yet\", but \"we remain optimistic that he will survive\". Ebola patients have a better chance of survival if they seek treatment soon after infection, as Dr Brantly did. The disease has killed at least 672 people in four West African countries since the outbreak began earlier this year in Guinea and spread to Liberia and Sierra Leone. Nigeria's airports and ports are on red alert following the death of a man from Liberia who was carrying the virus. It was the first case in Africa's most populous country. He vomited and had a high fever on board a passenger plane, and was immediately quarantined upon arrival in the capital Lagos. But he died in hospital from the virus on Friday. His flight had a stopover in Togo which is also on high alert as it may have spread there too. Dr Brantly, a family practice physician from Fort Worth, Texas, began working in Africa as part of a post-residency programme before the Ebola outbreak began. His family had been living with him in Africa but they are currently in the US. Dr Brantly is a medical director at an Ebola case management centre run by Samaritan's Purse. Photos show him working in white overalls made of a synthetic material that he wore for several hours each day while treating Ebola patients. Earlier this year, he was quoted on the organisation's website about efforts to maintain an isolation ward for patients. \"The hospital is taking great effort to be prepared,\" Dr Brantly said. \"In past Ebola outbreaks, many of the casualties have been healthcare workers who contracted the disease through their work caring for infected individuals.\" Ebola is highly contagious and kills up to 90% of people infected.

Meanwhile, the fact that a sick Liberian could board a flight to Nigeria raised new fears that other passengers could take the disease beyond Africa. Nigeria's international airports were screening passengers arriving from foreign countries, and health officials were also working with ports and land borders to raise awareness of the disease. Togo's government also said it was on high alert. Security analysts were skeptical about the usefulness of these measures. \"In Nigeria's case, the security set-up is currently bad, so I doubt it will help or have the minimum effectiveness they are hoping for,\" said Yan St. Pierre, CEO of the Berlin-based security consulting firm MOSECON. An outbreak in Lagos, a megacity where many lived in cramped conditions, could be a major public health disaster. The West Africa outbreak is believed to have begun as far back as January in southeast Guinea, though the first cases weren't confirmed until March. Since then, officials have tried to contain the disease by isolating victims and educating populations on how to avoid transmission, though porous borders and widespread distrust of health workers have made the outbreak difficult to bring under control. News of Brisbane's death first began circulating on Saturday, a national holiday marking Liberia's independence in 1847. President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf used her Independence Day address to discuss a new taskforce to combat Ebola. Information Minister Lewis Brown said the taskforce would go \"from community to community, from village to village, from town to town\" to try to increase awareness. In Sierra Leone, which has recorded the highest number of new cases in recent days, the first case originating in Freetown, the capital, came when a hairdresser, Saudata Koroma, fell ill. She was forcibly removed from a government hospital by her family, sparking a frantic search that ended Friday.

{"text": "(CNN) -- Police killed a suspected militant leader in a shootout in Russia's restive republic of Dagestan, state media said Tuesday, amid increasing security concerns ahead of the Winter Olympics in Sochi. It's also emerged that Russian authorities are hunting two more 'black widow' suspects -- a notorious type of terrorist that's emerged in Russia's clashes with Chechen separatists. The latest incidents have fueled debate over security at Sochi, despite assurances from Russian President Vladimir Putin that Russia will do its utmost to keep the Games secure. There have been years of unrest linked to an Islamist insurgency in Dagestan and the North Caucasus region, and Islamist militants have vowed to strike at the Games. Russian terrorism officials named the suspected militant killed Tuesday in Dagestan as Eldar Magato, state news agency RIA Novosti reported. Earlier, the news agency said Russian special forces were engaged in two operations in Dagestan, which lies about a 12-hour drive from Sochi on the other side of the Caucasus Mountains. Security forces killed three more suspected militants in Dagestan on Monday, it reported. 'Black widows' Meanwhile, a flier handed out by security forces to hotels in Rostov-on-Don, southeast Russia, names three women it says could carry out a suicide attack planned by militant groups between January 21 and 24, during the Olympic Torch Relay. One of the three, Zaira Nizamudinovna Alieva, was killed in a gun battle over the weekend in Dagestan in which seven militants reportedly died. She had been trained to be a suicide bomber, RIA Novosti cited terrorism officials as saying. The other two are named as Djannet Kurbanismailovna Tcakhaeva and Oksana Albertovna Aslanova. The pictures on the flier show two of the three women in Islamic headgear. But its text warns that the women may not be dressed that way. \"Suspected terrorists may use regularly clothing without any Islamic elements, e.g. no long dresses, no hijab, which makes it easier to blend into a crowd, and makes it easier to get access to large gatherings without being noticed,\" it says. Sochi suspect Police have also handed out fliers at Sochi area hotels warning of a woman they believe could be a terrorist and who now may be in the Black Sea resort town. One flier seen by CNN asks workers to be on the lookout for Ruzanna \"Salima\" Ibragimova, described as the widow of a member of a militant group from the Caucasus region. The woman, according to the flier, may be involved in organizing \"a terrorist act within the 2014 Olympic region.\" CNN obtained a copy of the flier, which is dated January 15, from security staff at a hotel in Sochi. The flier says authorities have received information about Ibragimova's possible arrival in the region last week. Photos of Ibragimova have flooded television and social media reports from Sochi, and some describe her as a \"black widow.\" Many of them are widows of insurgents killed by government forces, and they've been blamed for high-profile suicide bombings. Security experts stressed Monday that Ibragimova was probably one of many suspects that authorities are trying to find. \"I guarantee, they're talking about this one black widow,\" former CIA officer Mike Baker said, \"but there are others that they're also worried about.\" In a video that surfaced Sunday, two young men believed to have been suicide bombers in last month's back-to-back bombings in the Russian city of Volgograd made an ominous promise. \"We've prepared a present for you and all tourists who'll come over,\" the video says. \"If you will hold the Olympics, you'll get a present from us for the Muslim blood that's been spilled.\" The U.S. military has contingency plans in place for an evacuation of U.S. citizens in case of a major incident in Sochi.", "label": {"what": ["Police killed a suspected militant leader in a shootout in Russia's restive republic of Dagestan", "The latest incidents have fueled debate over security at Sochi", "Security forces killed three more suspected militants in Dagestan on Monday", "Zaira Nizamudinovna Alieva, was killed in a gun battle", "two young men believed to have been suicide bombers in last month's back-to-back bombings in the Russian city of Volgograd made an ominous promise"], "when": ["Tuesday", "emerged in Russia's clashes with Chechen separatists", "Earlier", "on Monday", "between January 21 and 24", "during the Olympic Torch Relay", "over the weekend", "in which seven militants reportedly died", "January 15", "last week", "Monday", "Sunday", "12-hour"], "where": ["in Russia's restive republic of Dagestan", "in Sochi", "in Dagestan and the North Caucasus region", "the Caucasus Mountains", "in Dagestan", "in Rostov-on-Don, southeast Russia", "in the Black Sea resort town", "from the Caucasus region", "at a hotel in Sochi", "in the region", "in the Russian city of Volgograd"], "why": ["There have been years of unrest linked to an Islamist insurgency in Dagestan and the North Caucasus region", "But its text warns that the women may not be dressed that way", "'Suspected terrorists may use regularly clothing without any Islamic elements, e.g. no long dresses, no hijab", "they've been blamed for high-profile suicide bombings.", "in case of a major incident in Sochi"], "who": ["state media", "Russian authorities", "Russian President Vladimir Putin", "Russia", "Russian terrorism officials", "state news agency RIA Novosti", "Russian special forces", "RIA Novosti cited terrorism officials", "Sochi suspect Police", "a member of a militant group", "security staff", "authorities", "Security experts", "former CIA officer Mike Baker", "The U.S. military", "U.S. citizens"], "damages": ["amid increasing security concerns ahead of the Winter Olympics in Sochi", "it says could carry out a suicide attack planned", "may be involved in organizing 'a terrorist act within the 2014 Olympic region", "If you will hold the Olympics, you'll get a present from us for the Muslim blood that's been spilled."], "countermeasures": ["are hunting two more 'black widow' suspects", "killed a suspected militant leader in a shootout", "Russia will do its utmost to keep the Games secure", "Russian special forces were engaged in two operations in Dagestan", "a flier handed out by security forces to hotels", "have also handed out fliers at Sochi area hotels", "asks workers to be on the lookout for Ruzanna 'Salima' Ibragimova", "have received information about Ibragimova's possible arrival", "Photos of Ibragimova have flooded television and social media reports from Sochi", "has contingency plans in place for an evacuation of U.S. citizens"], "perpetrators": ["a suspected militant leader", "two more 'black widow' suspects", "a notorious type of terrorist", "Islamist militants", "Eldar Magato", "three more suspected militants", "'Black widows", "Zaira Nizamudinovna Alieva", "Djannet Kurbanismailovna Tcakhaeva", "Oksana Albertovna Aslanova", "two of the three women in Islamic headgear", "The woman", "widows of insurgents killed by government forces,"], "how": ["have vowed to strike at the Games", "She had been trained to be a suicide bomber", "makes it easier to blend into a crowd, and makes it easier to get access to large gatherings without being noticed", "We've prepared a present for you and all tourists who'll come over"]}}
{"text": "U.S. counterterrorism operatives are helping Russian security agents in the hunt for four female potential terrorists, including a \"white widow\" -- the wife of a dead terrorist -- who could already be inside the massive security zone set up for next month's winter Olympics. Ruzanna Ibragimova, the 22-year-old widow of a jihadist killed by Russian security forces, is believed to have traveled from Dagestan to Sochi, according to a Russian security bulletin obtained by FoxNews.com, along with photos of her. The bulletin and photos were distributed by the Russian security force FSB and Sochi security officials to U.S. and other security agencies late last week. \"The notice is the first sign that terrorists may have managed to penetrate the security cordon,\" stated a bulletin from U.S. security forces that was obtained by FoxNews.com. An intelligence source who spoke to FoxNews.com called Ibragimova a \"white widow,\" and explained that the term is used to jihadists' widows who seek to \"blend in\" to mount attacks. But the term \"black widow\" is also prevalent as a description particularly of Chechen widows whose husbands have been killed in the ongoing fight against Russia. U.S. forces are working with their Russian counterparts inside the massive, 1,500-mile security zone set up to prevent attacks during next month's games.  Sochi security officials are \"looking for as many as four women,\" a source told FoxNews.com. According to our information, Ms. Ibragimova may be used by the ringleaders of illegal armed groups for the organization of terrorist acts in the zone of the 2014 Olympics,   read a bulletin put out by the FSB, which has also been distributed to hotels in the Sochi area. Ibragimova is believed to have traveled to Sochi on Jan. 11, or the next day. She was spotted recently on the street outside the foreign ministry near Sochi, a source told FoxNews.com. She was described as a white widow and known member of a Chechen jihadist group. \"Russia has deployed 40,000 police and security personnel in a \"ring of steel\" around Sochi to deter attacks by Islamist militants from the nearby North Caucasus republics,\" the U.S. bulletin states. U.S. and international experts have become increasingly concerned about security in the zone, in light of recent attacks and a call from Doku Umarov, the jihadist leader who has been described as Russia  s Bin Laden, for attacks and to stop Russia from hosting the games. We have our athletes over there and they are targets, so practically all our terrorism and national security agencies are operating over there,   the source said, explaining U.S. security and intelligence agency  s involvement in counterterror operations leading up to and during the Olympic games. On Sunday, a video was posted online by a group identifying itself as Vilayat Dagestan by two men claiming responsibility for recent suicide bombings of a train station and bus that killed 34 people in Volgograd. In the video, the men warn that other suicide attacks will follow. \"We'll have a surprise package for you,\" the men in the video said. \"And those tourists that will come to you, for them, too, we have a surprise KThis will be our revenge.\" The video was released one day before the Olympic torch relay is scheduled to go through Volgograd, formerly known as Stalingrad. U.S. officials are studying the video, according to security officials. On Jan. 9, Russian officials in Stavropol, about 300 miles from Sochi, caught a suspected would-be suicide bomber from the Muslim region of Karachayevo-Cherkessia, reportedly traveling with a small boy and equipped with a suicide bomb belt. The Russian FSB is still interrogating the woman, sources told FoxNews.com. \"In addition to the failed suicide-bomb plot, Russian authorities are also searching for Islamist militants suspected of killing six people throughout the region,\" according to a security memo. \"On January 9, 2014, authorities found the bodies of three men and explosive material in a vehicle in Maryinskaya, a Stavropol province.

The US and Russian leaders talked about how to ensure a \"safe and secure\" event next month in the Black Sea resort and nearby mountains, and also discussed Syrian transition talks in Geneva and nuclear diplomacy with Iran, the White House said. The United States has offered \"full co-operation\" to Russia on securing the Games, but there have been some complaints by members of Congress that Moscow has held back some intelligence. The call on Tuesday came amid signs of subtle but rising pressure on Russia from Washington over securing the Games. On Monday, the Pentagon said it was ready to deploy air and naval forces - including two ships - to help secure the Olympics, which begin on February 7. US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel had already offered American support during a January 4 phone call with his Russian counterpart Sergei Shoigu. Islamist insurgents based in North Caucasus republics such as Dagestan who are seeking their own independent state have vowed to disrupt the Sochi Games in an effort to undermine Putin. In a new video threat posted on a prominent North Caucasus Islamist website, two men sitting in front of a jihadist flag warn of planned attacks at the event. The introduction says the men were responsible for two suicide bombings in the southern city of Volgograd last month - Russia's deadliest in three years - which killed 34 people. Russian security officials are hunting down three potential female suicide bombers, one of whom is believed to be in Sochi.

The chilling video, posted on Sunday on the website of the Caucasus-based militant group Vilayat Dagestan, has renewed security fears ahead of the Sochi Olympics, which begin in 18 days. \"For the tourists who come, there will be a present too,\" says one of the men. The video claims that the men were the two suicide bombers responsible for twin blasts that killed 34 people in the city of Volgograd at the end of December. There was no confirmation of this, and Russian security officials did not comment on the video, which comes as US officials went public with their concerns about the level of intelligence sharing ahead of the games. The US military said on Monday that air and naval assets, including two ships in the Black Sea, would be made available to help Russia combat any possible terrorist attack. \"The United States has offered its full support to the Russian government as it conducts security preparations for the Winter Olympics,\" Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said in a statement reported by Reuters. \"Air and naval assets, to include two navy ships in the Black Sea, will be available if requested for all manner of contingencies in support of  V and in consultation with  V the Russian government.\" US officials acknowledge, however, that the likelihood of Russia asking the US for help would be low. Privately, Russian officials admit that the security threat is high and that there could be attacks in other Russian cities during the games, but believe that the \"ring of steel\" operation to secure Sochi makes an attack there extremely unlikely during the Olympics. Security will be provided by a mix of police, special forces, security agents, the army and Cossack volunteer patrols. In an interview with foreign TV networks over the weekend, President Vladimir Putin said the security would be extensive but low visibility: \"Security is to be ensured by some 40,000 law enforcement and special services officers  K We will protect our air and sea space, as well as the mountain cluster. I hope things will be organised in such a way that they don't catch the eye and, as I have already said, will not, so to say, depress the participants in the Olympic Games.\" The new video threat follows reports that Doku Umarov, self-styled \"emir\" of the North Caucasus terrorist movement, has been killed by Russian security forces. Umarov had promised attacks on the Olympics and the Russians have long wanted him dead. \"Journalists have been asking me whether Doku Umarov presents a threat to the Olympics in Sochi,\" said Ramzan Kadyrov, the Kremlin-backed ruler of Chechnya, last week. \"I have said before that he is dead, and we have now received a recording of some so-called 'emirs' [terrorist leaders], where they are discussing his death and consoling each other, and thinking about who to make the new head. They have more to worry about than the Olympics. So all the talk of a threat to the Olympics is absolutely unfounded.\" However, even if Umarov really is dead, it is unclear how much day-to-day control he had over the terrorist movement, which carries out frequent attacks on officials in the North Caucasus but has struggled to carry out large-scale attacks in Russia in recent years. Security experts suggest there are a large number of terrorist cells operating more or less independently across the Caucasus region. The Volgograd bombings showed that the potential is still there to strike at Russia's heartland, and in recent days there have also been reports of a female suicide bomber on the loose in Sochi, with hotel staff handed photographs of a woman in a pink headscarf who is believed to be planning a suicide attack. Mark Galeotti, a Russian security expert at New York University, said the Olympics were a matter of prestige for the terrorist underground as well as for Putin  V who on Monday received a boost with the news that the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, will attend the opening ceremony, unlike some other world leaders. \"[Terrorists] are haemorrhaging people to Syria and are in a battle for funding and support globally. Additionally, the regional groupings are battling for support with each other. They will really want to try to make an impact.\" Nevertheless, he said, while the Russian prevention tactics have hardly been subtle, they may well work due to the sheer amount of resources used: \"The Russians have played to their strengths. They have been going from door to door doing raids across the North Caucasus. It is not very precise, but the key tactic is to keep the terrorists busy trying to avoid being caught or shot, and thus too busy to plan anything during the Olympics.\" Andrei Soldatov, an investigative journalist specialising in the Russian security services, said that the heavy-handed approach had its weaknesses, however: \"There is a reliance on an entirely military response, and a weakness in intelligence gathering and informants.\" The government has ended an amnesty programme that allowed insurgents not involved in serious terror attacks to be \"rehabilitated\" and provided rich sources of intelligence. It also introduced tough laws that could see property confiscated from terrorists' relatives. \"The relatives of terrorists are exactly the people who should be the best source of intelligence,\" said Soldatov. The British Olympic Association has confirmed that it will include specific security staff in its delegation to Sochi, amid heightened concern about the safety of athletes. However, a BOA spokesman stressed that security officers had been part of the British delegation in some form at every Olympics since Athens in 2004. \"We will have security personnel as part of our delegation. That's not new, it's something we've done for every Olympics at least since Athens. We stay in regular communication with the FCO [Foreign and Commonwealth Office] and the Metropolitan police. That is standard practice for us and those lines of communication remain open,\" said a spokesman. Co-operation between the British and Russian security services was suspended in the wake of Alexander Litvinenko's murder with polonium in London in 2006, but when David Cameron visited Putin in Sochi last year, the pair said that intelligence sharing would be renewed before the Olympics. A source involved in the Games' security planning suggested relations between security services in the US, Britain and Russia had not only been \"thawed\" but had been \"put in the microwave\" in the runup to the Games in an attempt to share intelligence and ensure the safety of the 6,000 competitors and tens of thousands of spectators. However, US security officials have sounded less confident about the Russian preparations and level of intelligence sharing. Michael Morell, former deputy director of the CIA, said that the usual pre-Olympic intelligence sharing had simply not happened with the Russians: \"I think fundamentally they don't want to admit that they don't have complete control here and they might need some help,\" he told CBS.", "label": {"what": ["The chilling video, posted on Sunday on the website of the Caucasus-based militant group

{"text": "BRUSSELS  X Even as Russia imposes the most intensive security apparatus in Olympic history, the top military officers from the United States and Russia have opened discussions about using sophisticated American electronic equipment in a new effort to help secure the Winter Games in Sochi next month. The Russian delegation first raised the prospect of gaining access to the American technology, developed by the Pentagon to counter improvised explosive devices in Afghanistan and Iraq, Defense Department officials said on Tuesday. They emphasized that no decisions had been made yet. The potential for a technological exchange was part of an extensive discussion here on Tuesday, when Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, held his first face-to-face meeting with his Russian counterpart, Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov, chief of the general staff. President Obama and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia also discussed security at the Games in a phone conversation on Tuesday, Reuters reported. Few details were disclosed. General Dempsey said the Defense Department would be willing to provide equipment designed to detect and disrupt cellphone or radio signals used by militants to detonate improvised explosives from a distance. But he cautioned that technical experts from both nations first needed to make sure that the American systems could be integrated into the communications networks and security systems being set in place by Russia. In discussing the Pentagon  s technology to counter improvised explosives, General Dempsey noted that this was   something that we  ve become extraordinarily familiar with.   Homemade bombs planted by militants have been the leading cause of deaths and injuries to American service members in Afghanistan and Iraq. But the decision on whether to share the equipment is not a simple one. Especially during the early use of the technology, the American military found that it had created a muddle of electronic signals in which competing and overlapping systems canceled out the effectiveness of other systems in use at the same time and in the same area. If you  re not careful, you can actually degrade capability, not enhance it,   General Dempsey said. During their meetings here, the American and Russian military chiefs sought to advance an agenda of exchanges and continued cooperation on counterterrorism and antipiracy operations, despite the fact that diplomatic relations between Washington and Moscow swing between caustic disagreement and cautious cooperation. Even with their extensive agenda on bilateral security issues, the question of safety at the Olympics was thoroughly discussed, including a description by General Gerasimov of the close cooperation between the Russian military and its civilian law enforcement and intelligence services to provide security for the Games. General Gerasimov described in detail how Russian authorities   have in place the intelligence apparatus as well as the response apparatus to deal with the threats,   General Dempsey said. Generals Dempsey and Gerasimov met one day after Pentagon officials disclosed that the United States European Command was drawing up plans to have two Navy warships in the Black Sea at the time of the Games, should they be needed in case of emergency. In addition to deploying tens of thousands of police officers and military reinforcements to the Sochi area, the Russian government has tightened control inside the city ahead of the opening of the Games on Feb. 7, banning vehicles that are not registered in the region and requiring even Russians who visit to register with the police within three days, as foreigners must do. The threat of terrorism has become a grim reality of major sporting events, and Russian officials are acutely aware that these Games are being held near a region festering with Islamist separatists. Both the American and Russian generals  X who share a history of having commanded large tank and armored units  X emphasized the importance of improving communication between their armed forces. I think we have an opportunity to advance the relationship on areas of common interest,   General Dempsey said. He noted in particular that Moscow remains a vital partner for supply lines for the NATO mission in Afghanistan, agreeing to allow the movement of nonlethal material to and from the war zone through Russian territory; that rail and road network is becoming increasingly important as protests in Pakistan choke efforts to use the more convenient supply line there. General Dempsey said his Russian counterpart was concerned about the potential for further instability in Afghanistan after the NATO combat mission there officially ends this year. General Gerasimov has asked for updates on the American and NATO effort to train, advise and equip Afghan National Security Forces, General Dempsey said, as well as Afghanistan  s ability to maintain and control transportation lines in and out of the country. He is absolutely concerned, as I would be in his place,   General Dempsey said. In brief remarks welcoming General Dempsey to the Russian mission to NATO in suburban Brussels, General Gerasimov endorsed   regular contacts   between the militaries as   quite useful. General Dempsey, in an interview, said it was important for the two militaries   not to foreclose on conversations, even if at some points there are disagreements that prevent the forward movement   in other parts of the relationship, whether political or diplomatic.", "label": {"what": ["the top military officers from the United States and Russia have opened discussions about using sophisticated American electronic equipment in a new effort to help secure the Winter Games in Sochi next month", "The Russian delegation first raised the prospect of gaining access to the American technology", "The potential for a technological exchange was part of an extensive discussion here on Tuesday", "Putin of Russia also discussed security at the Games in a phone conversation on Tuesday", "General Gerasimov described in detail how Russian authorities have in place the intelligence apparatus as well as the response apparatus to deal with the threats"], "when": ["next month", "on Tuesday", "at the same time", "During their meetings here", "one day after Pentagon officials disclosed", "at the time of the Games", "on Feb. 7", "ahead of the opening of the Games", "within three days", "ends this year"], "where": ["in Sochi", "in the same area", "in Afghanistan and Iraq", "in the Black Sea", "the Sochi area", "in the region", "near a region festering with Islamist separatists", "in Afghanistan", "from the war zone through Russian territory", "in and out of the country", "in suburban Brussels"], "why": ["in a new effort to help secure the Winter Games", "counter improvised explosive devices in Afghanistan and Iraq", "Homemade bombs planted by militants", "provide security for the Games", "in case of emergency", "the importance of improving communication between their armed forces", "as protests in Pakistan choke efforts to use the more convenient supply line there", "at some points there are disagreements"], "who": ["the top military officers from the United States and Russia", "The Russian delegation", "the Pentagon", "Defense Department officials", "Gen.

{"text": "Russian police are on the hunt for a potential female suicide bomber in the Black Sea resort city of Sochi, where the Winter Olympics are set to begin next month. People in Sochi say police have distributed photos of the female suspect, who is said to be the widow of an Islamic militant from the predominantly Muslim region of Dagestan. She has been identified as 22-year-old Ruzanna Ibragimova, nicknamed   Salima. The Associated Press reports police are also searching for two other women suspected of being possible suicide bombers. Russian officials have blamed the so-called   black widows   of slain insurgents for previous suicide attacks in the country. On Sunday, an Islamic militant group from Dagestan posted a video online claiming responsibility for last month  s deadly suicide bombings in Volgograd, which killed 34 people. The two men in the video also threaten attacks at the Olympics. It is unclear when the video was made. Thousands of athletes and spectators from all over the world are expected to travel to Sochi for the Olympic Games, which will feature competitors in a variety of winter sports, including skiing, skating and ice hockey. The U.S. military pledged Monday to make air and naval support available to the Russian government as it makes security preparations for the Olympics.

{"text": "With the Sochi Olympic games just weeks away, Russian authorities are trying to locate three women they suspect of being suicide bombers. Why are they calling them \"black widows\"? Have women been involved in terrorist attacks in Russia before? WSJ's Jason Bellini has #TheShortAnswer.\nMOSCOW XRussian security officials confirmed Tuesday that two Islamists who issued a video claiming responsibility for suicide attacks in Volgograd that killed 34 people in December appeared to have been the actual bombers. Weeks before Russia hosts the Winter Olympics in the Black Sea resort city of Sochi, the bombers promised more attacks by fellow insurgents in the video. They also issued a chilling plea to Islamists deep inside Russia to launch other attacks on their own, highlighting how Russia's Islamist threat has spread within the country despite a two-decade Kremlin crackdown. The call for violence comes amid heightened tensions domestically and abroad over security for the Games that President Vladimir Putin has vowed will be safe. Although Russia has cast a massive security cordon around Olympic facilities and the city of Sochi, some Olympic officials say fears of mayhem may be deterring some visitors from attending Olympic Games held so close to a simmering Islamist insurgency. The Pentagon, earlier this week, said that it has two naval ships in the Black Sea that \"will be available if requested for all manner of contingencies\" during the Games. On Tuesday, a delegation of U.S. lawmakers visited Sochi, where police are on high alert for potential suicide attacks. Police were distributing leaflets warning that one potential female suicide bomber, the widow of a slain militant, was on the loose in Sochi. Police and military have meanwhile stepped up operations against Islamists in the North Caucasus province of Dagestan Xapproximately 500 miles from Sochi Xa region that has in recent years become the center of Russia's rebel unrest. Officials in Dagestan on Tuesday said they shot dead a rebel leader wanted for attacks on police and extortion of businessmen. They said they also defused one bomb and engaged in a shootout with militants who took refuge in a house. The self-proclaimed leader of the Islamist insurgents, Doku Umarov, last year issued an appeal to his followers to use \"maximum force\" to disrupt the Olympic Games, which he called \"satanic dancing on the bones of our ancestors.\" In recent weeks, unconfirmed reports have alleged that Mr. Umarov was killed in air or artillery strikes in southern Chechnya last year, though previous reports of his death have been proved wrong in the past. While his death would mark a propaganda victory for the Kremlin, it would have little impact on the Islamist movement in Russia, analysts say. \"For years he has been leader of rebels in name only and has been devoting all his time to staying alive,\" said Mairbek Vatchagaev, a Paris-based analyst with the Jamestown Foundation think tank in Washington. \"He is never involved in any fighting or attacks.\" Russian Police Forces Step Up Security Crackdown Ahead of Games\nDec. 10 Police in Dagestan detain 52 people allegedly connected to outlawed Islamic group Hizbut-Tahrir, which is outlawed in Russia.

XSource: Official reports Over the years, the Kremlin has stamped out various rebel groups, only to be confronted with new adversaries. Shortly after Mr. Putin came to power in 1999, Russian forces invaded Chechnya, which had gained de facto independence, and killed or captured nearly all of Chechnya's secular separatist leaders. Those leaders were supplanted by Islamist commanders who mounted ghastly attacks on civilian targets, including a Moscow theater, Nord Ost, where 170 died, in 2002 and, two years later, an elementary school in the provincial town of Beslan where 380 people died, most of them children. Russian security services have killed most of the Islamist rebel leaders, but now are confronted by smaller groups that raise money on their own and mount attacks in the North Caucasus on a nearly daily basis. The smaller groups can be difficult for Russian police to counter, because their members are often young and have no criminal records or history of fighting Russian forces. \"The older generation of fighters are dead and so now [police] have to confront people they don't know,\" Mr. Vatchagaev said. The groups often swear allegiance to Mr. Umarov, who in 2007 proclaimed himself Emir of the Caucasus Emirate, a putative state that spans Russia's North Caucasus and that includes the city of Sochi. But analysts say Mr. Umarov has been confined to a rugged, mountainous region of Chechnya while he evades a Russian security dragnet. Last week, the Kremlin-backed president of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, said he was sure Mr. Umarov was dead because security services intercepted a phone call of two rebel leaders who discussed electing a new emir. But Mr. Kadyrov didn't release the recording, and he has claimed several times before that Mr. Umarov was dead, only to see him reappear afterward. In the video posted by the Volgograd bombers, the men thanked Mr. Umarov for approving their mission but encouraged sympathizers to devise their own attacks without contacting any rebel hierarchy in Russia's North Caucasus. The men sat before a black jihadi flag while holding automatic weapons and coached sympathizers to form small groups and launch attacks deep inside Russia. \"On our website you can safely learn about explosives, how to make a bomb, incendiary mixtures, poisons, whatever,\" one of the men said. \"You're better off working alone, brothers. Inside Russia, three people at the most, and be very careful.\" Their video showed how they assembled some bombs and then wired one to a detonation switch that was taped to a bomber's arm. They promised Russians more attacks to disrupt the Olympics. \"As for the Olympics that you want so much, we have a present for you,\" said one of the men, while the other cradled his gun and grinned. \"And for those tourists who will come, God willing, we will also have a present.\" Police haven't identified the men, who smuggled explosives into the city of Volgograd despite a heightened state of security in the aftermath of a suicide bombing of a bus there in October.

{"text": "Olympic committees in Germany, Hungary, Italy, Slovenia and the UK have received messages threatening their delegations, although officials dismissed them as unfounded Terrorist threats received by several national Olympic committees have set off another security scare over the Sochi Games, even as Russian police continue to search for a suspected suicide bomber in the city. Olympic committees in Germany, Hungary, Italy, Slovenia and the UK have received messages threatening their delegations at the Winter Olympics, which begins in two weeks, although officials dismissed them as unfounded. Nonetheless, taken with the news of a potential suicide bomber on the loose, the threats have raised concerns about the impregnability of Sochi, where security is at unprecedented levels. The British Olympic Association confirmed it had received a terror threat but said it   lacks credibility  . We have received what appears to be the same email that many other federations have received and the IOC has responded to state very clearly that in their view there is nothing of substance to this,   the BOA director of communications, Darryl Seibel, said. Meanwhile, Russian authorities have been conducting a manhunt for three women they fear may be planning suicide attacks targeting the Games. Police leaflets in Sochi warned that Ruzana Ibragimova, a 22-year-old   Black Widow   of a militant killed by security forces, was at large in the city. Security officials also put out wanted posters for Oksana Aslanova, 26, and Dzhannet Tsakhayeva, 34, saying the women were planning attacks in Rostov-on-Don, where the Olympic torch procession arrived today. A fourth suspected bomber, Zaira Aliyeva, 26, was killed on Saturday by security forces in Russia  s restive Dagestan republic, NBC News reported. Sochi is beside Russia  s North Caucasus region, which has been plagued by violence related to an Islamist insurgency. In a video on the website of a North Caucasus militant group, two men claimed credit for the double suicide bombing that killed 34 people in Volgograd in December and promised a   present   for tourists at the Olympics. An alleged female suicide bomber from the North Caucasus previously killed six people on a bus in Volgograd. But President Vladimir Putin has pledged the Games will be safe, and Russian authorities are deploying up to 60,000 law enforcement personnel around Sochi, more than double the number on hand for the much bigger London Games. As part of their   ring of steel   operation, the city has been closed off to all vehicles not registered in the city since 7 January. Security experts raised doubts about the ongoing manhunt and said that even if Ibragimova or another potential suicide bomber has penetrated the   ring of steel  , it does not necessarily raise the risk of a terrorist attack. This kind of information that a certain person is terrorist and part of a plot is often spread without being verified,   said Gregory Shvedov, the editor of Caucasian Knot, an information agency that covers violence in the North Caucasus and nearby regions. Notably, a Russian blogger posted photos of Ibragimova in August and a warning that she was likely planning an imminent terrorist attack, in an apparent indication that she has been sought before. Mark Galeotti, a professor at New York University and expert on Russia  s security services, said there was   no evidence   that terrorists have the necessary structure and explosives to carry out an attack in Sochi. But he said   there will almost certainly be attacks on the outside   of the Sochi security zone during the Olympics.", "label": {"what": ["Olympic committees in Germany, Hungary, Italy, Slovenia and the UK have received messages threatening their delegations, although officials dismissed them as unfounded", "Terrorist threats received by several national Olympic committees have set off another security scare over the Sochi Games", "Russian police continue to search for a suspected suicide bomber in the city", "two men claimed credit for the double suicide bombing that killed 34 people in Volgograd in December and promised a 'present' for tourists at the Olympics", "a Russian blogger posted photos of Ibragimova in August and a warning that she was likely planning an imminent terrorist attack"], "when": ["in two weeks", "today", "on Saturday", "in December", "since 7 January", "in August", "during the Olympics"], "where": ["in the city", "at the Winter Olympics", "Sochi", "in Rostov-on-Don", "in Russia s restive Dagestan republic", "In a video on the website of a North Caucasus militant group", "in Volgograd", "from the North Caucasus", "on a bus in Volgograd", "the Sochi security zone"], "why": ["the news of a potential suicide bomber"], "who": ["Olympic committees in Germany, Hungary, Italy, Slovenia and the UK", "officials", "several national Olympic committees", "Russian police", "The British Olympic Association", "the BOA director of communications, Darryl Seibel", "the IOC", "Russian authorities", "Police", "Security officials", "security forces", "NBC News", "President Vladimir Putin", "Russian authorities", "Security experts", "Gregory Shvedov, the editor of Caucasian Knot, an information agency that covers violence in the North Caucasus and nearby regions", "a Russian blogger", "Mark Galeotti, a professor at New York University and expert on Russia\u2019s security services"], "how": ["The British Olympic Association confirmed it had received a terror threat but said it lacks credibility", "more than double the number on hand for the much bigger London Games", "As part of their 'ring of steel' operation", "Security experts raised doubts about the ongoing manhunt", "This kind of information that a certain person is terrorist and part of a plot is often spread without being verified", "there was 'no evidence' that terrorists have the necessary structure and explosives to carry out an attack in Sochi", "he said 'there will almost certainly be attacks on the outside' of the Sochi security zone during the Olympics"], "damages": ["the threats have raised concerns about the impregnability of Sochi, where security is at unprecedented levels", "killed 34 people", "killed six people"], "countermeasures": ["the IOC has responded to state very clearly that in their view there is nothing of substance to this", "Russian authorities have been conducting a manhunt for three women they fear may be planning suicide attacks targeting the Games", "Police leaflets in Sochi warned that Ruzana Ibragimova, a 22-year-old 'Black Widow' o f a militant killed by security forces, was at large in the city", "Security officials also put out wanted posters for Oksana Aslanova, 26, and Dzhannet Tsakhayeva, 34, saying the women were planning attacks in Rostov-on-Don", "A fourth suspected bomber, Zaira Aliyeva, 26, was killed on Saturday by security forces in Russia s restive Dagestan republic", "President Vladimir Putin has pledged the Games will be safe", "Russian authorities are deploying up to 60,000 law enforcement personnel around Sochi", "the city has been closed off to all vehicles not registered in the city since 7 January"], "perpetrators": ["three women", "Ruzana Ibragimova", "Oksana Aslanova", "Dzhannet Tsakhayeva", "Zaira Aliyeva", "An alleged female suicide bomber"]}}
{"text": "Let's start with a riddle. If South Yorkshire Police can mount a raid on Sir Cliff Richard's home in pursuit of evidence linked to a single allegation of child sex abuse 30 years ago, why were South Yorkshire Police incapable of pursuing multiple allegations against multiple men who raped 1,400 children over 16 years? One thousand four hundred. Consider the weight of that number, feel its tragic heft. Picture 50 junior-school classes of little girls in Rotherham, once a respectable northern town, now a byword for depravity. We have seen child-grooming cases before, but the disgusting stories revealed in the report by Professor Alexis Jay amount to evidence of abuse on an industrial scale. Men of Pakistani heritage treated white girls like toilet paper. They picked children up from schools and care homes and trafficked them across northern cities for other men to join in the fun. They doused a 15-year-old in petrol and threatened to set her alight should she dare to report them. They menaced entire families and made young girls watch as they raped other children. These truly horrible things happened in our country C not in the distant, cruel past, but as recently as last year. All but one of the perpetrators were Muslims of Pakistani heritage who would have related to Cliff's hit, Living Doll. The living dolls of Rotherham were bent and twisted to their masters' will. There was no escape. As the sterling Professor Jay observes, South Yorkshire Police \"regarded many child victims with contempt\". One 11-year-old known as Child H told police that she and another girl had been sexually assaulted by grown men. Nothing was done. When she was 12, Child H was found in the back of a taxi with a man who had indecent pictures of her on his phone. Despite the full co-operation of her father, who insisted his daughter was being abused, police failed to act. Four months later, Child H was found in a house alone with a group of Pakistani men. What did the police do? They arrested the child for being drunk and disorderly and ignored her abusers. As President Obama said about the fiends who beheaded the journalist James Foley: \"No just God would stand for what they did.\" My, what the British people would give to hear such ringing moral condemnation from our own political leaders. The Labour Party, in particular, is mired in shame over \"cultural sensitivity\" in Rotherham. Especially, cynics might point out, a sensitivity to the culture of Muslims whose votes they don't want to lose. Denis MacShane, MP for Rotherham from 1994 to 2012, actually admitted to the BBC's World At One yesterday that \"there was a culture of not wanting to rock the multicultural community boat, if I may put it like that. Perhaps, yes, as a true Guardian reader and liberal Leftie, I suppose I didn't want to raise that too hard.\" Much better to hang on to your impeccable liberal credentials than save a few girls from being raped, eh, Denis? Equally horrifying is the suggestion that certain Pakistani councillors asked social workers to reveal the addresses of the shelters where some of the abused girls were hiding. The former deputy leader of the council, Jahangir Akhtar, is accused of \"ignoring a politically inconvenient truth\" by insisting there was not a deep-rooted problem of Pakistani-heritage perpetrators targeting young white girls. The inquiry was told that influential Pakistani councillors acted as \"barriers to communication\" on grooming issues. Front-line youth workers who submitted reports in 2002, 2003 and 2006 expressing their alarm at the scale of the child sex-offending say the town hall told them to keep quiet about the ethnicity of the perpetrators in the interests of \"community cohesion\". Fear of appearing racist trumped fears of more children being abused. Not only were negligent officials not prosecuted, they prospered. Shaun Wright, a former Labour councillor who was in charge of Rotherham children's services during a five-year period when a blind eye was turned to the worst case of mass child abuse in British history, is now South Yorkshire's Police and Crime Commissioner. Oh, Jonathan Swift, thou shouldst be writing at this hour! Jane Collins, the Ukip MEP for Yorkshire and Humber, has called for Mr Wright to stand down, a demand that has been echoed by Labour as it realises the full horror of what was done C or not done C by its councillors. \"To cover up something of this scale, it is evil,\" says Mrs Collins. It's impossible not to share that incredulous fury. Powerless white working-class girls were caught between a hateful, imported culture of vicious misogyny on the one hand, and on the other a culture of chauvinism among the police, who regarded them as worthless slags. Officials trained up in diversity and political correctness failed to acknowledge what was effectively white slavery on their doorstep. Much too embarrassing to concede that it wasn't white people who were committing racist hate crimes in this instance. The whole thing is like a real-life episode of Prime Suspect, in which councillors, the police and child-protection staff collude to give a bunch of sadistic thugs licence to pimp a town's most vulnerable children. As they say in Yorkshire: \"They want shooting, the lot of them.\" This will come as no comfort to the 1,400 brutalised girls, many of whom have self-harmed or committed suicide, but I reckon Rotherham may be the final nail in the coffin of multiculturalism. Far from discouraging racism, the Labour policy of withholding the ethnic identity of men who preyed on white girls backfired spectacularly. Criminally, it endangered hundreds of children who might otherwise have been spared. A recent poll showed that 44 per cent of young Britons believe that Muslims do not share the same values as the rest of the population, while 28 per cent said they felt Britain would be \"better off\" with fewer Muslims. Attitudes are even more negative among older people. A recent Radio 4 item about how junior jihadists spending their gap year massacring people in Iraq could be \"reintegrated\" into British society produced hoots of derision on social media and spilt tea across the breakfast tables of England. (Hands up anyone who wants the blighters back?) The period of giving the benefit of the doubt to young Muslims who go on \"camping holidays\" to Syria is over. Undoubtedly, the fact that \"Jihadi John\", the hooded man who was party to the beheading of James Foley, spoke with a London accent has provoked further despair about the widespread failure of Muslims to integrate. Has it really come to this? A child raised with all the freedoms and blessings of a British upbringing behaving like a natural-born barbarian. My colleague Boris Johnson's excellent suggestion that any Britons who travel to Syria and Iraq without informing the authorities should be presumed to be potential terrorists until proven innocent produced howls of outrage from the human rights brigade C but it struck an entire symphony of chords with Britons of all creeds and colours who are sick of being taken for mugs. There are other hopeful signs. The Rotherham scandal seems temporarily to have silenced those who insist, every time a child-grooming case is exposed, that most paedophiles are white. Indeed they are; but the Rotherham abusers were not paedophiles. They were men of Pakistani heritage slaking their lust on young girls they regarded as white trash because they knew they could get away with it. It grieves me to say they were right. Like South Yorkshire Police, they treated 1,400 defenceless children \"with contempt\". On Channel 4 News on Tuesday, Javed Khan, the chief executive of Barnardo's, refused to give a straight answer to a question about the part that \"ethnicity\" played in the abuse of girls in Rotherham. As the presenter Jackie Long persisted, Mr Khan insisted that we should not be focusing on the identity of the perpetrators because it \"distracted attention\" from the children who were their victims. On the contrary. It is of the utmost importance that wider society wakes up to the fact that there is what the inquiry found to be a \"deep-rooted problem of Pakistani-heritage perpetrators targeting young white girls\". Many of us who have been saying this for a long time have been shouted down as racist. Thanks to Prof Jay, it has been stated publicly for the first time that the fear of appearing racist was more pressing in official minds than enforcing the law of the land or rescuing terrified children. It is one of the great scandals of our lifetime. The Labour council of Rotherham stands accused of ignoring child sex abuse on an unimaginable scale for 16 years. There can be no more serious charge against a public body. Former councillors who dismissed evidence or otherwise attempted to pervert the course of justice should be arrested. Officers who snubbed appeals from desperate children and their families have no place in our police force. Thus far, a mere five men have been jailed in connection with the disgusting crimes in Rotherham. A further 30 are under investigation. We need a campaign to get other abused children to come forward and receive the appropriate help. We need them to identify the perpetrators. Shame and name, and shame again. Above all, we need those girls to know that what was done to them was criminal, and the way those crimes were ignored and suppressed by powerful men with a political agenda was despicable as well as criminal. To avoid rocking the multicultural boat, they fed 1,400 children to the sharks. No just God would stand for what they did.", "label": {"what": ["South Yorkshire Police incapable of pursuing multiple allegations against multiple men who raped 1,400 children over 16 years", "They picked children up from schools and care homes and trafficked them", "They menaced entire families and made young girls watch as they raped other children", "certain Pakistani councillors asked social workers to reveal the addresses of the shelters where some of the abused girls were hiding", "councillors, the police and child-protection staff collude to give a bunch of sadistic thugs licence to pimp a town's most vulnerable children", "The Rotherham scandal seems temporarily to have silenced those who insist, every time a child-grooming case is exposed, that most paedophiles are white", "men of Pakistani heritage slaking their lust on young girls they regarded as white trash", "a 'deep-rooted problem of Pakistani-heritage perpetrators targeting young white girls'"], "when": ["as recently as last year", "Four months later", "from 1994 to 2012", "yesterday", "in 2002, 2003 and 2006", "on Tuesday"], "where": ["across northern cities", "in our country", "in Rotherham", "in Yorkshire", "On Channel 4 News"], "why": ["for other men to join in the fun", "is mired in shame over 'cultural sensitivity'", "a sensitivity to the culture of Muslims whose votes they don't want to lose", "there was a culture of not wanting to rock the multicultural community boat", "Fear of appearing racist trumped fears of more children being abused", "it realises the full horror of what was done or not done by its councillors", "Powerless white working-class girls were caught between a hateful, imported culture of vicious misogyny on the one hand, and on the other a culture of chauvinism among the police, who regarded them as worthless slags", "they knew they could get away with it", "it 'distracted attention' from the children who were their victims", "the fear of appearing racist was more pressing in official minds than enforcing the law of the land or rescuing terrified children.

{"text": "Members of Britain's Pakistani community reacted with outrage Wednesday amid reports that officials failed to act on sex abuse cases because of concerns about racism in the northern English town of Rotherham. Muhbeen Hussain, founder of Rotherham Muslim Youth Group, told the Daily Mirror on Wednesday that Muslims are disgusted that justice was not done  leading to some 1,400 children being sexually exploited over a 16-year period, mostly by Pakistani men. \"Race, religion or political correctness should never provide a cloak of invisibility to such grotesque crimes.\" Report author Alexis Jay cited appalling acts of violence between 1997 and 2013 in the town of some 250,000.

The chorus of voices raised against him, which includes the leadership of his own party, is, rightly, swelling. He should have gone at once. His lack of leadership, his reluctance to ask difficult questions or to intervene proactively, allowed the exploitation itemised in Professor Alexis Jay's grim report on Tuesday to grow from what an earlier investigator called gang abuse for personal gratification into \"financial and career opportunities\" for young, mainly Asian, men. His failure to take responsibility now, in the face of the evidence, suggests a dangerous reluctance to address what went so damagingly wrong for so many vulnerable young women. No wonder some of them have now launched a class action against the council. Rotherham is not alone in experiencing colossal institutional failure in child protection. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, and a pattern of abuse that has now resulted in convictions in towns from Torbay to Rochdale is very likely to be happening in other places not yet identified. But its experience should offer at least a checklist for behaviour that should trigger alarm. In particular, councils should examine just how C in the words of the Office of the Children's Commissioner C they see and hear children who may be in trouble. As so often, many of those in Rotherham who should have been on the victims' side saw these vulnerable children as authors of their own misfortunes and failed, cruelly, to listen to their accounts. Then there was a misguided reluctance to consider whether there was an issue of race involved. Finally, they lacked any kind of institutional data-sharing that might have allowed police, schools, hospitals and social workers to understand what was happening. The question of ethnicity is particularly contentious. Rotherham is a very white, poor, working-class town with a growing but still small C less than 10% C black and minority ethnic population of which less than a third is Muslim. In last May's local elections, Ukip won most votes and became the official opposition on the council. A march by the English Defence League during the campaign drew 500 supporters. On Tuesday, one of the first on Twitter with a gloating tweet was Nick Griffin of the BNP. In that context it is understandable that the Labour council was sensitive to the reputation of its Muslim community. But it led to a terrible misjudgment: the subordination of the safeguarding of abused and exploited children C who were mainly, but not only, white C to the protection of the standing of one particular community. When the then Labour MP Ann Cryer, the anti-forced-marriage campaigner, began reporting accounts of young Pakistani-heritage men hanging about school gates in 2003, she was bitterly criticised. So, more recently, was the Times reporter Andrew Norfolk, whose painstaking investigation has done so much to bring the exploitation to light. Ethnicity did play a part in the Rotherham abuse, not because this particular pattern of abuse is restricted to a particular group (the behaviour is typical of many gangs) but because many of those who might have taken action feared the wider, societal, consequences if they did. Like all sexual abuse, this was an example of the exploitation of the weak, and it is teaching some hard lessons. The CPS recognises that prosecutions can go ahead even when victims give confused accounts of abuse, reported long after the event. The value of gathering and sharing data between agencies is now widely understood. But the clearest lesson is that nothing, at all, must come before the need to protect the vulnerable, and those who fail must be held to account.", "label": {"what": ["refusing to resign", "He apologises unreservedly for the grotesque abuse that 1,400 children or more may have endured on his watch ", "some of them have now launched a class action against the council", "experiencing colossal institutional failure in child protection", "saw these vulnerable children as authors of their own misfortunes", "failed, cruelly, to listen to their accounts", "lacked any kind of institutional data-sharing that might have allowed police, schools, hospitals and social workers to understand what was happening", "Ukip won most votes and became the official opposition on the council", "reporting accounts of young Pakistani-heritage men hanging about school gates", "she was bitterly criticised", "painstaking investigation", "bring the exploitation to light"], "when": ["from 2005 until 2010", "on Tuesday", "last May", "during the campaign", "in 2003"], "where": ["in towns", "Torbay", "Rochdale", "in Rotherham", "on Twitter"], "why": ["for the grotesque abuse", "a pattern of abuse", "The question of ethnicity", "because many of those who might have taken action feared the wider, societal, consequences if they did"], "who": ["Shaun Wright, Labour's South Yorkshire police and crime commissioner", "Rotherham's cabinet member for children and young people's services", "the leadership of his own party", "Professor Alexis Jay", "an earlier investigator", "young, mainly Asian, men", "so many vulnerable young women", "the Office of the Children's Commissioner", "white, poor, working-class", "black and minority ethnic", "the English Defence League", "500 supporters", "Nick Griffin of the BNP", "the Labour council", "Muslim community", "abused and exploited children", "Labour MP Ann Cryer, the anti-forced-marriage campaigner", "the Times reporter Andrew Norfolk", "the weak", "The CPS", "agencies", "the vulnerable", "those who fail"], "how": ["the scale of the abuse has come as a surprise to him", "His lack of leadership", "his reluctance to ask difficult questions or to intervene proactively", "see and hear children who may be in trouble", "Like all sexual abuse"], "charges": ["launched a class action against the council", "His failure to take responsibility"], "plead": ["give confused accounts of abuse"], "sentence": ["The chorus of voices raised against him", "resulted in convictions in towns", "be held to account"]}}
{"text": "At least 1,400 children were subjected to appalling sexual exploitation in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013, a report has found. Children as young as 11 were raped by multiple perpetrators, abducted, trafficked to other cities in England, beaten and intimidated, it said. The report, commissioned by Rotherham Borough Council, revealed there had been three previous inquiries. Council leader Roger Stone said he would step down with immediate effect. Mr Stone, who has been the leader since 2003, said: \"I believe it is only right that as leader I take responsibility for the historic failings described so clearly.\" The inquiry team noted fears among council staff of being labelled \"racist\" if they focused on victims' descriptions of the majority of abusers as \"Asian\" men. 'Doused in petrol' Professor Alexis Jay, who wrote the latest report, said there had been \"blatant\" collective failures by the council's leadership, senior managers had \"underplayed\" the scale of the problem and South Yorkshire Police had failed to prioritise the issue. Prof Jay said: \"No-one knows the true scale of child sexual exploitation in Rotherham over the years. Our conservative estimate is that approximately 1,400 children were sexually exploited over the full inquiry period, from 1997 to 2013.\" Revealing details of the inquiry's findings, Prof Jay said: \"It is hard to describe the appalling nature of the abuse that child victims suffered.\" The inquiry team found examples of \"children who had been doused in petrol and threatened with being set alight, threatened with guns, made to witness brutally violent raped and threatened they would be next if they told anyone\". Five men from the town were jailed for sexual offences against girls in 2010, but the report said police \"regarded many child victims with contempt\". District Commander for Rotherham, Ch Supt Jason Harwin said: \"Firstly I'd like to start by offering an unreserved apology to the victims of child sexual exploitation who did not receive the level of service they should be able to expect from their local police force. \"We fully acknowledge our previous failings.\" Ch Supt Harwin said the force had \"overhauled\" the way it dealt with such cases and had successfully prosecuted a number of abusers. But he admitted: \"I accept that our recent successes... will not heal the pain of those victims who have been let down.\" 'Racism' fear The report found: \"Several staff described their nervousness about identifying the ethnic origins of perpetrators for fear of being thought as racist; others remembered clear direction from their managers not to do so.\" Failures by those charged with protecting children happened despite three reports between 2002 and 2006 which both the council and police were aware of, and \"which could not have been clearer in the description of the situation in Rotherham\". Prof Jay said the first of these reports was \"effectively suppressed\" because senior officers did not believe the data. The other two were ignored, she said. The inquiry team found that in the early-2000s when a group of professionals attempted to monitor a number of children believed to be at risk, \"managers gave little help or support to their efforts\". The report revealed some people at a senior level in the police and children's social care thought the extent of the problem was being??;r?;??????? \"exaggerated\". Prof Jay said: \"The authorities involved have a great deal to answer for.\" A victim of abuse in Rotherham, who has been called \"Isabel\" to protect her identity, told BBC Panorama: \"I was a child and they should have stepped in. \"No matter what's done now... it's not going to change that it was too late, it should have been stopped and prevented.\" Analysis James Vincent, BBC Look North The scale of this report is simply staggering and some of the detail extremely hard to read. It lays out how Rotherham Council and the police knew about the level of child sexual exploitation in the town, but didn't do anything about it. They either didn't believe what they were being told, played it down, or were too nervous to act. The failures, the report says, are blatant. The report estimates 1,400 children were sexually exploited over 16 years, with one young person telling the report's author that gang rape was a usual part of growing up in Rotherham. The processes for dealing with these crimes have got better in the last four years, but still improvements need to be made. There were more apologies from the council today but the report's author says they are too late. Speaking about her abuser, Isabel said: \"I think because the police were aware and social services were aware and he knew that and they still didn't stop him it I think it encouraged him. \"It almost became like a game to him. He was untouchable.\" Speaking after the publication of the report, Victims' Commissioner Baroness Newlove said: \"I'm appalled by the extent of the horrific abuse endured by these vulnerable victims. \"It's deeply distressing how the authorities failed to protect these young people and their voices were not heard. \"Everyone involved needs to take responsibility for the shocking failings that this report has exposed. This must not happen again. \"I want to see every one of these victims getting the right support now and for as long as it takes them to help them on the path to recovery.\" Maggie Atkinson, children's commissioner for England, said the number of identified child victims was \"largely consistent\" with the findings of their own national inquiry into \"child sexual exploitation in gangs and groups\". 'Horrific experiences' Rotherham council's chief executive, Martin Kimber, said he accepted the report and the recommendations made and apologised to the victims of abuse. He said: \"The report does not make comfortable reading in its account of the horrific experiences of some young people in the past, and I would like to reiterate our sincere apology to those who were let down when they needed help. \"I commissioned this independent review to understand fully what went wrong, why it went wrong and to ensure that the lessons learned in Rotherham mean these mistakes can never happen again. \"The report confirms that our services have improved significantly over the last five years and are stronger today than ever before. \"This is important because it allows me to reassure young people and families that should anyone raise concerns we will take them seriously and provide them with the support they need. \"However, that must not overshadow - and certainly does not excuse - the finding that for a significant amount of time the council and its partners could and should have done more to protect young people from what must be one of the most horrific forms of abuse imaginable.\"", "label": {"what": ["At least 1,400 children were subjected to appalling sexual exploitation in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013", "raped by multiple perpetrators, abducted, trafficked to other cities in England, beaten and intimidated", "three previous inquiries", "fears among council staff of being labelled 'racist'", "senior managers had 'underplayed' the scale of the problem", "South Yorkshire Police had failed to prioritise the issue", "the force had 'overhauled' the way it dealt with such cases", "nervousness about identifying the ethnic origins of perpetrators", "Failures by those charged with protecting children happened", "the first of these reports was 'effectively suppressed'", "The other two were ignored", "managers gave little help or support to their efforts", "Rotherham Council and the police knew about the level of child sexual exploitation in the town, but didn't do anything about it", "didn't believe what they were being told, played it down", "too nervous to act", "The processes for dealing with these crimes have got better in the last four years", "he accepted the report and the recommendations made and apologised to the victims of abuse", "our services have improved significantly over the last five years and are stronger today than ever before"], "when": ["between 1997 and 2013", "since 2003", "in 2010", "between 2002 and 2006", "in the early-2000s", "over 16 years", "today", "in the past"], "where": ["in Rotherham", "other cities in England", "in petrol", "in the town"], "why": ["for sexual offences against girls", "for fear of being thought as racist", "because senior officers did not believe the data", "to protect her identity", "because the police were aware and social services were aware and he knew that and they still didn't stop him it I think it encouraged him", "because it allows me to reassure young people and families that should anyone raise concerns we will take them seriously and provide them with the support they need"], "who": ["Children as young as 11", "Council leader Roger Stone", "the leader", "The inquiry team", "council staff", "the majority of abusers", "'Asian' men", "Professor Alexis Jay, who wrote the latest report", "child victims", "police", "District Commander for Rotherham, Ch Supt Jason Harwin", "a group of professionals", "a number of children", "some people at a senior level in the police and children's social care", "A victim of abuse in Rotherham, who has been called 'Isabel'", "BBC Panorama", "Analysis James Vincent, BBC Look North", "the report's author", "Victims' Commissioner Baroness Newlove", "these vulnerable victims", "these young people", "Everyone involved", "Maggie Atkinson, children's commissioner for England", "Rotherham council's chief executive, Martin Kimber", "the council and its partners"], "how": ["It is hard to describe the appalling nature of the abuse that child victims suffered", "had been doused in petrol", "threatened with being set alight", "threatened with guns", "made to witness brutally violent raped", "threatened they would be next if they told anyone", "by offering an unreserved apology to the victims of child sexual exploitation who did not receive the level of service they should be able to expect from their local police force", "The scale of this report is simply staggering", "some of the detail extremely hard to read"], "charges": ["collective failures by the council's leadership", "prosecuted a number of abusers"], "plead": ["take responsibility for the historic failings", "fully acknowledge our previous failings"], "sentence": ["Five men from the town were jailed"]}}
{"text": "South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner Shaun Wright has resigned from the Labour Party after it threatened to suspend him over the Rotherham abuse scandal but has vowed to remain in his PCC role. The Labour party called for him to resign as PCC and threatened to suspend him from the Party if he had not done so by the morning, however on his website Mr Wright refused to leave the role. In a statement he said: \"I formally tender my resignation from the Labour Party. However, I remain committed to, and intend to remain in, my role as an Independent Police and Crime Commissioner for South Yorkshire. \"I entered into public service over twenty years ago to make a positive difference. Protecting vulnerable people has been my number one priority as Police and Crime Commissioner for South Yorkshire. I have had to make the difficult decision to stand down from the Labour Party and it's with deep regret that I've come to that decision. \"I stand by my earlier comments that I've taken that experience to deliver a major transformation in the way South Yorkshire Police deals with horrific crimes such as child sexual exploitation, and much progress has been made since I was elected as Commissioner in terms of supporting victims, taking preventive action, increasing awareness of the issue and bringing criminals to justice. I was elected to deliver the people's policing and crime priorities in South Yorkshire and I intend to see that duty through by leading the force on that urgent, and fundamental, journey of improvement for the sake of past, present and potential victims, who are the most important people in all of this.\" There is no power to remove him from his 85,000-a-year position as PCC. On Newsnight Jack Domney, Shadow Minister for Home Affairs, called for powers to be introduced to allow the Government to remove PCC's from their positions. Mr Wright was the council cabinet member responsible for children's services in Rotherham from 2005 to 2010, in the middle of a 16-year period when 1,400 youngsters suffered widescale sexual exploitation including gang rapes, grooming and trafficking. Labour MP John Mann has written a letter to the Home Secretary Theresa May calling for multiple misconduct charges to be brought against those responsible. He said: \"Having looked at the misconduct law it clearly can apply in situations like this and the severity of the issue makes a misconduct in public office charge appropriate for those who sat on reports in the council and in the South Yorkshire police. Multiple charges need to be considered. \"As Shaun Wright is one who needs investigating I will be asking the Home Secretary to use another police force to investigate.\" Mr Wright said he believed the report into the Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal, by Professor Alexis Jay, should have gone further in naming officials responsible for the failings identified in the report. Prof Jay has cast doubt on the assertion that Mr Wright did not know about what was happening in the town. She said: \"Part of my remit was to identify what information was available to key people in positions of influence throughout that time. \"And there was certainly a very great deal of information available from an early stage; indeed from at least 2001, both through a youth project which did outreach work with these young victims and children's social care. \"But also because there were at least three key reports which were made available to the agencies concerned whose conclusions couldn't have been clearer. \"Then finally members of the council had seminars organised at which the detail of the youth project and indeed some of the other material ... was included in that. \"Names of potential perpetrators, car registration numbers, a very great deal of detail.

Despite calls for him to quit over the sex abuse scandal, South Yorkshire's Police and Crime Commissioner Shaun Wright has vowed to stay in his job. Wright was a Labour cabinet member for children and young people's services at Rotherham Council from 2005 to 2010, when he received three reports about widespread abuse but failed to act. The Labour Party has now called for his resignation. Prof Jay said: \"Within social care, the scale and seriousness of the problem was underplayed by senior managers. At an operational level, the police gave no priority to child sex exploitation, regarding many child victims with contempt and failing to act on their abuse as a crime.\" Police officers even dismissed the rape of children by saying that sex had been consensual. 'Racism' fears Tuesday's report concluded that by far the majority of perpetrators were Asian men. According to the inquiry council officials were afraid to identify the ethnic origins of perpetrators for fear of being labelled \"racist\" if they revealed the ethnicity of most of the abusers. Downing Street on Tuesday night described the failure to halt the abuse in Rotherham as \"appalling.\" A Number 10 spokesman said: \"We are determined that the lessons of past failures must be learned and that those who have exploited these children are brought to justice.\" Following the publication of the report, Rotherham Council leader Roger Stone resigned. Stone, who has been the leader since 2003, said: \"I believe it is only right that as leader I take responsibility for the historic failings described so clearly.\" No other council employees will face disciplinary proceedings after it was claimed that there was not enough evidence to take action. The focus on Rotherham followed the jailing of five Asian men in 2010 after they were found guilty of grooming teenage girls for sex. The five men groomed teenage girls and had sex with them in cars and parks in Rotherham. Schools also started raising alerts over the years about children as young as 11 being picked up by taxis, given presents and mobile phones and taken to Rotherham and other towns. 'Authorities failed to protect children' Prof Jay said there had been \"blatant\" collective failures by the council's leadership, senior managers had \"underplayed\" the scale of the problem and South Yorkshire Police had failed to prioritize the issue.

It emerged that there had been three previous reports looking into the problem which had been suppressed or ignored by officials, either because they did not like or did not believe the findings.

{"text": "Members of Britain's Pakistani community reacted with outrage Wednesday amid reports that officials failed to act on sex abuse cases because of concerns about racism in the northern English town of Rotherham. Report author Alexis Jay said between 1997 and 2013, some 1,400 children were sexually exploited in the town of 250,000, mostly by Pakistani men. Charities that deal with abused children have expressed shock not just at the number of victims but by the apparent reluctance of town authorities to address the fact that people of Pakistani heritage were involved for fear they would be labelled racists. Muhbeen Hussain, founder of Rotherham Muslim Youth Group, told the Daily Mirror on Wednesday that Muslims are disgusted that justice was not done in Rotherham. \"Race, religion or political correctness should never provide a cloak of invisibility to such grotesque crimes,\" he said. Barnardo's, a charity that works with vulnerable children, unilaterally condemned the abuse that left so many to suffer for so long. \"No one should ever be frightened to act decisively because of fear of being seen as racist or politically incorrect,\" said Barnardo's chief executive, Javed Khan. Britain's Labour Party called for the resignation of the police commissioner in the town, a member of its own ranks, after the report found that \"collective failures,\" led to inaction. But Jay said Rotherham is not the only place in Britain struggling with this issue. She told the BBC that \"demand for this kind of sexual activity with children is on the increase and that is validated across not just the UK but Europe and worldwide.\" \"We can't say that Rotherham is any better or worse than other places because the information simply doesn't exist at a national level to tell us that,\" she said.", "label": {"what": ["officials failed to act on sex abuse cases", "some 1,400 children were sexually exploited in the town of 250,000, mostly by Pakistani men", "Charities that deal with abused children have expressed shock", "justice was not done in Rotherham", "condemned the abuse that left so many to suffer for so long"], "when": ["between 1997 and 2013", "on Wednesday"], "where": ["town of Rotherham", "in Britain", "Europe and worldwide"], "why": ["because of concerns about racism in the northern English town of Rotherham", "the number of victims", "the apparent reluctance of town authorities to address the fact that people of Pakistani heritage were involvedfor fear they would be labelled racists", "because of fear of being seen as racist or politically incorrect", "because the information simply doesn't exist at a national level"], "who": ["Members of Britain's Pakistani community", "Report author Alexis Jay", "Muhbeen Hussain, founder of Rotherham Muslim Youth Group", "the Daily Mirror", "Barnardo's, a charity that works with vulnerable children", "Barnardo's chief executive, Javed Khan", "Britain's Labour Party", "the BBC"], "how": ["reacted with outrage", "Muslims are disgusted"], "charges": ["officials failed to act on sex abuse cases", "'collective failures", "inaction"], "plead": ["Rotherham is not the only place in Britain struggling with this issue", "demand for this kind of sexual activity with children is on the increase"], "sentence": ["called for the resignation of the police commissioner in the town"]}}
{"text": "Under-pressure Shaun Wright has resigned from the Labour Party but has insisted he will remain police and crime commissioner for South Yorkshire. Mr Wright has faced calls to step down after a report on child abuse in Rotherham, where he managed children's services between 2005 and 2010. The report said at least 1,400 children were sexually exploited from 1997-2013, mainly by Pakistani-heritage gangs. A Labour MP now wants a possible misconduct case against Mr Wright. Meanwhile, former Rotherham council chief executive Mike Cuff has also said he had to \"take my share of responsibility for the council's failure to prevent the appalling abuse which has been so clearly described in this independent report\". 'Reiterate my apology' In a statement, Mr Wright said he had \"formally\" tendered his resignation from the Labour Party. But Mr Wright insisted he was the most appropriate person to hold the office of commissioner (PCC). \"I remain committed to, and intend to remain in, my role as an Independent Police and Crime Commissioner for South Yorkshire,\" he said. \"As a father, and a citizen of South Yorkshire, my thoughts are with the victims and their families and I reiterate my apology to them and take full responsibility for my part in the collective failures which took place at Rotherham Council during the time I was in office, and indeed to that end I resigned in 2010,\" he continued. \"I stand by my earlier comments that I've taken that experience to deliver a major transformation in the way South Yorkshire Police deals with horrific crimes such as child sexual exploitation, and much progress has been made since I was elected as commissioner in terms of supporting victims, taking preventive action, increasing awareness of the issue and bringing criminals to justice.\" Position 'untenable' Shadow policing minister Jack Dromey had earlier told the BBC Mr Wright would be suspended from the Labour Party if he had not resigned by Thursday morning. Now Labour backbencher John Mann MP is to write to Home Secretary Theresa May asking for the police to investigate whether a case of misconduct in public office could be brought against Mr Wright and others involved in the allegations in Rotherham. Mr Mann said the inquiry should not be carried out by South Yorkshire Police, but by another force. Mrs May has said Mr Wright should \"heed calls\" to resign, though she stressed it was not her job to hire and fire PCCs. \"I think he has real questions to answer,\" she said. Rotherham MP Sarah Champion has also called for Mr Wright's resignation, along with shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper, shadow chancellor Ed Balls and shadow welfare minister Chris Bryant. Harry Harpham, chairman of South Yorkshire's police and crime panel, which scrutinises the work of the South Yorkshire PCC, told the BBC's Today programme Mr Wright's position had become \"untenable\" and he should go \"at the earliest opportunity\" He said: \"He can only be removed from office by resigning or unless he commits a criminal offence. \"We are not able to remove him, however, I will seek an urgent meeting with Shaun to let him know my position.\" 'On my watch' Mr Cuff, who was the council's chief executive from 2004 to 2009, echoed Mr Wright's apology. \"It was on my watch that the organised abuse of young girls by a gang of Asian men came to light,\" he said. \"This led eventually to their conviction in 2010. I know that professional social workers and the police worked well together to support the abused girls and to secure the successful prosecution of their abusers. \" This \"close co-operation\" between agencies \"holds the key to the effective protection of vulnerable young people in the future\", he added. The report, commissioned by the council, was published on Tuesday and revealed the massive level of abuse in Rotherham, mainly by Pakistani heritage criminal gangs. The inquiry team noted fears among council staff of being labelled \"racist\" if they focused on victims' descriptions of the majority of abusers as \"Asian\" men. Key findings of the report Children as young as 11 were raped by multiple attackers, trafficked to other towns and cities in the north of England, abducted, beaten and intimidated. The \"collective failures\" of political, police and social care leadership were \"blatant\" over the first 12 years covered by the inquiry. Police were said to have given child sex exploitation no priority, regarding many child victims \"with contempt\" and failing to act on their abuse as a crime. The majority of those behind the abuse were described as Asian, while the majority of the reported victims were young white girls.

{"text": "Senior former officials at Rotherham council during the years of ignored warnings about the huge scale of sexual grooming and abuse in the town continue to work in prominent childcare positions despite links to one of Britain's worst protection scandals. The Independent has established that at least three senior officials employed by Rotherham council during the period covered by the inquiry now hold high-ranking roles at other local authorities. Amid growing anger that nobody had been held to account for the scandal, Shaun Wright, the police and crime commissioner for South Yorkshire accused of failing to address widespread exploitation while serving as a Labour councillor in Rotherham, announced late on Wednesday that he would not quit his post. However, Mr Wright, who was the council cabinet member responsible for children's services in Rotherham from 2005 to 2010, said he had tendered his resignation from the Labour Party, after party sources said he would be suspended unless he resigned as commissioner by Thursday morning. Those calling for him to quit included Theresa May, the Home Secretary, who also questioned the role of other officials involved in the council's inability to address the abuse by paedophile gangs that left 1,400 victims over the 16 years examined by the report. The local authority has accepted the findings of a report that highlighted blatant failings by political and council officer leadership over the 12 years from 1997, but no current staff working with vulnerable children have been disciplined or sacked. The report avoided apportioning blame to individuals, but this leaves unanswered questions about the suitability of former Rotherham officials to continue working in child safeguarding positions elsewhere. Its author, Professor Alexis Jay, said: \"I think it would be easy enough to look at the list of people I interviewed at the back of the report. I'm not suggesting for a minute that anyone listed there is culpable but it's clear who the individuals are whom I have referred to in the report.\" Rotherham council said it was writing to the current employers of former officials still working in child protection because of the critical nature of the report. It has declined to say who will be contacted, but those interviewed during the course of the inquiry included four former chief executives, former directors of child safeguarding and a former director of children's services during the period under examination. The people interviewed included those praised in the report for their work in highlighting the problems. The report released on Tuesday detailed an atmosphere of bullying and sexism at the authority, where staff felt unwilling to raise the issue of grooming and abuse by men predominantly from the town's Pakistani community because of concerns that they would be accused of racism. The police were also accused of treating many of the victims with contempt and undeserving of police protection. \"I've been able to read part of this report and I've seen frankly the horrific cases that they have looked into where young girls who were the victims of the most appalling sexual exploitation and threats of violence, grooming abuse; and yet their calls for help went unheeded by the council or by the police,\" said Mrs May. \"I'm afraid this betrays an issue of attitude that was being taken towards these girls. I think there are some real lessons for us to learn here and I think everybody needs to look at the role they played in this and at their position.\" Professor Jay said it was not her role to decide who should be made accountable but said that those in \"positions of power and influence over these 16 years should look very carefully at their own actions and indeed perhaps others should also look at their actions to determine whether they could have done more\". Officials who held positions during the period include the current chief executive of Liverpool City Council, who was head of Rotherham's council when a report that detailed failures by police and the council was suppressed because senior officers did not believe its contents. Ged Fitzgerald, who was chief executive at Rotherham from 2001-2003, and his current council declined to comment. South Yorkshire Police, which said it had charged 29 people with child exploitation offences since 2010, said it would report any cases to the police watchdog where there was evidence that police failed to investigate properly or covered up evidence. \"Clearly many mistakes were made over the period covered by the report and the acknowledgement that there have been a number of improvements to policing practice and resourcing in the last four years is welcome,\" the force said in a statement. Doncaster Council said it was making its own inquiries after it employed Jackie Wilson as its assistant director of children and young people's services in January this year. Ms Wilson was interviewed by Professor Jay's inquiry because of the managerial role she held at Rotherham from 2002-2007. Doncaster's chief executive, Jo Miller, said: \"The crimes that have been perpetrated in Rotherham over many years are appalling. The report is profoundly shocking. Now we have sight of the report we are considering any implications for Doncaster and are liaising with Rotherham council as well as making our own enquiries. We will not comment on individual staffing matters at this time.\" A former director of safeguarding from 2004-2009, Pam Allen, is working for East Riding council as head of children and young people's support and safeguarding services. A former director of children's services is also working for the state of Victoria in Australia. Ms Allen did not return a call for comment. The council declined to comment beyond saying it had not been contacted by its counterparts in Rotherham. The child protection coordinator at Rotherham from 1998 to 2003, Erica Leach, worked at Nottinghamshire County Council for three years in the same role. Steve Edwards, service director for children's social care, said: \"If we receive concerns about the past conduct of any of our staff from another local authority we would always conduct a thorough investigation.\" There is no direct attribution of blame in the report but it highlights a litany of missed opportunities and failures to identify and prevent the problem. The council leader stepped down on the publication of the report, but Mr Wright, who declined to follow suit despite demands from Yvette Cooper and Ed Balls among the Labour hierarchy, insisted he had no knowledge of the \"industrial scale\" of abuse in the town, saying the report should have gone further to \"name names\" about those who had failed to protect youngsters from abuse. Victim's story: 'I didn't realise I was being groomed' One abuse victim has told The Independent how she had almost daily dealings with police when, as a 14-year-old, she was being driven around Rotherham by a convicted criminal who had groomed her for sex. Jessica, not her real name, is one of 15 women to take legal action against Rotherham Borough Council over its failings. She said she was abused for two years by a man who was 10 years her senior, and whom she considered to be her boyfriend. Yet he physically and sexually assaulted her and threatened to kill her when she tried to get free. \"He told me that if he couldn't have me nobody else would,\" she said. She said that her family was destroyed after she went missing from home for up to two months and she was eventually put into care to try to ensure that she was no longer able to meet her abuser. \"When I was with him, we were being stopped three or four times a week by police,\" she added. She said officers suggested she give a statement but \"when you are groomed you have someone influencing you so much. All that work has to be undone. It was only two years ago that I realised that I was groomed and abused.\" Nobody has, as yet, been convicted in her case but she said it is currently being investigated by police.", "label": {"what":

{"text": "Fingerprints and photos of two men who boarded the doomed Malaysia Airlines passenger jet are being sent to U.S. authorities so they can be compared against records of known terrorists and criminals. The cause of the plane's disappearance has baffled investigators and they have not said that they believed that terrorism was involved, but they are also not ruling anything out. The investigation into the disappearance of the jetliner with 239 passengers and crew has centered so far around the fact that two passengers used passports stolen in Thailand from an Austrian and an Italian. The plane which left Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, was headed for Beijing. Three of the passengers, one adult and two children, were American. Today Malaysia's Civil Aviation Chief Azaharuddin Abdul Rahman said officials had reviewed surveillance tape of the plane's boarding \"from check-in right to departure.\" When asked about the two men who used the stolen passports, Rahman replied, \"We confirmed now they are not Asian looking males.\" When pressed to describe them, he said indicated that one of the men is black. Do you know a footballer by the name of Bartoli? Do you know what he looks like?\" Rahman asked. Reporters corrected him asking, \"Mario Balotelli?\" and asked whether the man with the stolen passport was black. Balotelli, who is black, is an Italian soccer player. \"Yes,\" Rahman replied. Rahman refused to further describe the two men. U.S. authorities plan to run the photos and fingerprints of the two men against databases of known criminals and terrorists in hopes of finding a match, a senior official said. Another senior counter-terrorist official said that finding out more about those two men could be the key to understanding how and why the flight suddenly disappeared mid-flight Saturday. Until we get more information on the two people using the stolen passports and ascertain whether they were involved, or they [search parties] find the debris and do forensics, its all just conjecture, the counter-terrorism official said. While there has been rampant speculation about the possible role of terrorism in the missing plane, the counter-terrorism official and other high-level U.S. officials have said so far there is no evidence to indicate thats the case , beyond an unverifiable claim of responsibility by a little-known Asian extremist group. The U.S. is not picking up any intel, no chatter, the counter-terrorism official said, referring to communications often intercepted by American intelligence in the wake of a terrorist attack that can often lead to clues about suspects. The bad guys arent even discussing itK Its an awkward situation. There is nothing from which to draw any firm conclusion yet. Rahmam, speaking about the surveillance video, also said, \"I can confirm that all security protocols had been complied with.\" The Search for the Missing Malaysia Airlines Passenger Jet Rahman indicated that investigators were not any closer to determining what happened to the Boeing 777 jet, a plane with an excellent safety record, or where the plane was. Samples from an oil slick off the southern coast of Vietnam determined it was not from the plane. And Vietnams National Committee for Search and Rescue told ABC New that an orange object spotted floating in the ocean over the weekend originally thought to be a life raft from the plane had nothing to do with the plane wreckage, During an earlier press briefing today, a reporter asked Malaysia's Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein about reports that a media personality received an open letter from the leader of Chinese Martyr Brigade claiming responsibility for the incident. When asked about the letter, a Malaysian official said, \"Yes, there is sound ground to say it is true, but again, we have said from the beginning that we are not taking anything for granted.\" But at the later news conference, Rahman said, \"We dont know what happened to the aircraft, so we cannot speculate... We cannot do guess work.\" He said the search area was being expanded to include an additional expanse of ocean as well as land at the northern tip of Malaysia. The search grid was divided into boxes with individual ships assigned to each box. It was now nighttime in Asia, which brought a search by air to a halt. But he said planes would resume crisscrossing the search grid for signs of the plane at daybreak. Dozens of aircraft and ships have contributed to the search, including crews from Vietnam, China, Singapore, Indonesia, the United States, Thailand, Australia and the Philippines, Rahman said at a press conference today.

{"text": "(CNN) -- A delegation of painters and calligraphers, a group of Buddhists returning from a religious gathering in Kuala Lumpur, a three-generation family, nine senior travelers and five toddlers. Most of the 227 passengers on board missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 were Chinese, according to the airline's flight manifest. The 12 missing crew members on the flight that disappeared early Saturday were Malaysian. Other passengers were from India, Indonesia, Australia, the United States, France, New Zealand, Ukraine, Canada, Russia and the Netherlands, the airline said. The airline's list showed the passengers hailed from 14 countries, but later it was learned that two people named on the manifest -- an Austrian and an Italian -- whose passports had been stolen were not aboard the plane. The plane was carrying five children under 5 years old, the airline said. On Saturday, Texas-based Freescale Semiconductor confirmed that 20 employees were passengers on Flight 370. Twelve are from Malaysia and eight from China, the company said. \"At present, we are solely focused on our employees and their families,\" Gregg Lowe, Freescale's president and CEO, said in the statement. \"Our thoughts and prayers are with those affected by this tragic event.\" First officer was transitioning to 777-200s Later, the company tweeted: \"Your thoughtful words and prayers for Freescale families and friends affected by MH370 give comfort.\" The company was making counselors available with around-the-clock support for employees affected by the tragedy, the statement said. The 154 passengers from China (including Taiwan) included a group of painters and calligraphers and Buddhists returning from a religious gathering, Chinese state media reported. Relatives of the Chinese citizens aboard gathered Saturday at a hotel complex in the Lido district of Beijing as a crowd of reporters gathered outside. \"My son was only 40 years old,\" one woman wailed as she was led inside. \"My son, my son. What am I going to do?\" Agonized families await answers Family members were kept in a hotel conference room, where media outlets had no access. Most of the family members have so far refused to talk to reporters. An Austrian Foreign Ministry spokesman said a man listed on the airline's manifest is safe and was never aboard the aircraft. The Austrian national's passport was stolen two years ago, Austrian Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Weiss said. Italian Foreign Ministry spokesman Aldo Amati also said no one from his country was on the plane, even though an Italian was on the manifest. Malaysian officials said they were aware of reports the Italian's passport had been stolen, but had not confirmed that. U.S. nationals on the plane's manifest were identified by the airline as Philip Wood, 51; Nicole Meng, 4; and Yan Zhang, 2. A senior U.S. State Department official confirmed Saturday that three U.S. citizens were aboard the aircraft. Embassy officials were trying to determine whether additional U.S. citizens were on the flight. \"We extend our deepest condolences to the loved ones of those on board Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370,\" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. \"Officials from the U.S. Embassies in Kuala Lumpur and Beijing are in contact with the individuals' families. Out of respect for them, we are not providing additional information at this time.\" Among them is Philip Wood, who graduated from Oklahoma Christian University in 1985 according to school spokeswoman Risa Forrester.

{"text": "Vietnamese aircraft spotted what they suspected was one of the doors belonging to the ill-fated Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 on Sunday, as troubling questions emerged about how two passengers managed to board the Boeing 777 using stolen passports. The discovery comes as officials consider the possibility that the plane disintegrated mid-flight, a senior source told Reuters. The state-run Thanh Nien newspaper cited Lt. Gen. Vo Van Tuan, deputy chief of staff of Vietnam's army, as saying searchers in a low-flying plane had spotted an object suspected of being a door from the missing jet. It was found in waters about 56 miles south of Tho Chu island, in the same area where oil slicks were spotted Saturday. \"From this object, hopefully (we) will find the missing plane,\" Tuan said. Thanh Nien said two ships from the maritime police were heading to the site. An authority told Reuters that it was too dark to be certain the object was part of the missing plane, and that more aircraft would be dispatched to investigate the site in waters off southern Vietnam in the morning. Rahman said that the search area has been increased to 50 nautical miles, from 20, and includes 34 aircraft and 40 ships. Aircraft are conducting 12-hour searches, until sundown, while ships are scheduled to continue the search throughout the night. Meanwhile, Interpol says no country checked its database for information about stolen passports that were used to board the Malaysia Airlines flight that disappeared with 239 people on board Saturday less than an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, bound for Beijing. In a sharply worded criticism of shortcomings of national passport controls, the Lyon, France-based international police body said information about the thefts of an Austrian passport in 2012 and an Italian passport last year was entered into its database after they were stolen in Thailand. Interpol said in a statement it was investigating all other passports used to board the flight and was working to determine the \"true identities\" of the passengers who used the stolen passports. \"I can confirm that we have the visuals of these two people on CCTV,\" Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said at a news conference late Sunday, adding that the footage was being examined. \"We have intelligence agencies, both local and international, on board.\" Hussein declined to give further details, saying it may jeopardize the investigation. Hussein said only two passengers had used stolen passports, and that earlier reports that the identities of two others were under investigation were not true. European authorities on Saturday confirmed the names and nationalities of the two stolen passports: One was an Italian-issued document bearing the name Luigi Maraldi, the other Austrian under the name Christian Kozel. Police in Thailand said Maraldi's passport was stolen on the island of Phuket last July. A telephone operator on a China-based KLM hotline on Sunday confirmed to The Associated Press that \"Maraldi\" and \"Kozel\" were both booked to leave Beijing on a KLM flight to Amsterdam on March 8. Maraldi was then to fly to Copenhagen, Denmark, on KLM on March 8, and Kozel to Frankfurt, Germany, on March 8. \"It sounds very much like a rumor and if it is, we certainly can't comment on that,\" Nintendo's media representative told Reuters on Friday. One gaming company manager said Dong's decision to take down the game was wise. She said since the pair booked the tickets through China Southern Airlines, she had no information on where they bought them. The ticket purchases reportedly took place almost simultaneously, and the tickets were numbered consecutively, according to the BBC. A U.S. official told Fox News that a key priority is clarifying the status of the passports, whether they were lost or stolen, and determining through airport security screening and video who got on the flight under those names. The statements came as officials said finding the wreckage of the flight is the utmost priority.\" There is still no sign of the aircraft, Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, director general of the Department of Civil Aviation, said during a news conference in Kuala Lumpur. The U.S. Navy sent a warship, the USS Pickney, which was conducting training and maritime security operations off the South China Sea, and a surveillance plane. Singapore said it would send a submarine and a plane. China and Vietnam were sending aircraft to help in the search. It is not uncommon for it to take several days to find the wreckage of an aircraft floating on the ocean. Locating and then recovering the flight data recorders, vital to any investigation, can take months or even years. When pressed on reports of fake passports used by at least two passengers on board the flight and the possibility of a terrorist attack, Rahman re-stated that the priority is to find the aircraft and that any probe investigating a terror link is independent of the search mission. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has also said it is too early to make any conclusive remarks. Earlier, Malaysias air force chief told reporters that military radar indicated that the plane may have turned from its flight route before losing contact. Rodzali Daud didn't say which direction the plane might have taken when it apparently went off route. \"We are trying to make sense of this,\" he told a media conference. \"The military radar indicated that the aircraft may have made a turn back and in some parts, this was corroborated by civilian radar.\" Malaysia Airlines Chief Executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said pilots were supposed to inform the airline and traffic control authorities if the plane does start to return. \"From what we have, there was no such distress signal or distress call per se, so we are equally puzzled,\" he said. Vietnamese air force planes spotted two large oil slicks late Saturday in the first sign that the aircraft had crashed. The slicks were each between 6 miles and 9 miles long, the Vietnamese government said in a statement. But there was no confirmation that the slicks were related to the missing plane, but the statement said they were consistent with the kinds that would be produced by the two fuel tanks of a crashed jetliner. The plane was carrying 227 passengers, including two infants and 12 crew members when it lost all contact, with Subang Air Traffic Control at 2:40 a.m., two hours into the flight, the airline said. The plane was expected to land in Beijing at 6:30 a.m. Saturday. Around the time the plane vanished, the weather was fine and the plane was already at cruising altitude, making its disappearance all the more mysterious. Just 9 percent of fatal accidents happen when a plane is at cruising altitude, according to a statistical summary of commercial jet accidents done by Boeing. The plane was last inspected 10 days ago and found to be \"in proper condition,\" Ignatius Ong, CEO of Malaysia Airlines subsidiary Firefly airlines, said at a news conference. The lack of a radio call \"suggests something very sudden and very violent happened,\" said William Waldock, who teaches accident investigation at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Ariz. The plane \"lost all contact and radar signal one minute before it entered Vietnam's air traffic control,\" Lt. Gen. Vo Van Tuan, deputy chief of staff of the Vietnamese army, said in a statement issued by the government. U.S. officials said late Saturday that a team of safety experts had been dispatched to Southeast Asia to assist in the investigation. Officials from the National Transportation Safety Board told Fox News that the team, which includes investigators from the agency and technical experts from the Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing, had been sent to the region despite the fact that the plane had not been located due to the lengthy travel time from the U.S. and the team's desire to be in a position to assist local authorities right away. The FBI is also assisting in the search. Meanwhile, a former intelligence official told Fox News that the information about stolen passports from two adjacent European countries, combined with recent warnings for flights to the United States about the risk of possible shoe bomb attacks, is concerning. The airline said onboard the plane, there were 152 passengers from China, 38 from Malaysia, seven from Indonesia, six from Australia, five from India and three from the U.S. and others from Indonesia, France, New Zealand, Canada, Ukraine, Russia, Taiwan and the Netherlands. The U.S. State Department later confirmed in a statement that three Americans were aboard the jetliner. In the United States, a friend confirmed to the Associated Press that an IBM executive from North Texas named Philip Wood had been aboard the jet. Freescale Semiconductor, a company based in Texas, also confirmed Saturday that 20 of its employees -- 12 from Malaysia and eight from China -- were passengers. The airline says the plane's pilot is Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, a 53-year-old who has been with the airline for over 30 years. The plane's first officer is Fariq Ab.Hamid, a 27-year-old who joined the airline in 2007. Both are Malaysians. At Beijing's airport, authorities posted a notice asking relatives and friends of passengers to gather at a hotel about nine miles from the airport to wait for further information, and provided a shuttle bus service. Malaysia Airlines has 15 Boeing 777-200 jets in its fleet of about 100 planes.

{"text": "New York:  The most dangerous parts of a flight are takeoff and landing. Rarely do incidents happen when a plane is cruising seven miles above the earth. So the disappearance of a Malaysia Airlines jet well into its flight on Saturday morning over the South China Sea has led aviation experts to assume that whatever happened was quick and left the pilots no time to place a distress call. It could take investigators months, if not years, to determine what happened to the Boeing 777 flying from Malaysia's largest city of Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. \"At this early stage, we're focusing on the facts that we don't know,\" said Todd Curtis, a former safety engineer with Boeing who worked on its 777 jumbo jets and is now director of the Airsafe.com Foundation. If there was a minor mechanical failure - or even something more serious like the shutdown of both of the plane's engines - the pilots likely would have had time to radio for help. The lack of a call \"suggests something very sudden and very violent happened,\" said William Waldock, who teaches accident investigation at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Ariz. It initially appears that there was either an abrupt breakup of the plane or something that led it into a quick, steep dive. Some experts even suggested an act of terrorism or a pilot purposely crashing the jet. \"Either you had a catastrophic event that tore the airplane apart, or you had a criminal act,\" said Scott Hamilton, managing director of aviation consultancy Leeham Co. \"It was so quick and they didn't radio.\" No matter how unlikely a scenario, it's too early to rule out any possibilities, experts warn. The best clues will come with the recovery of the flight data and voice recorders and an examination of the wreckage. Airplane crashes typically occur during takeoff and the climb away from an airport, or while coming in for a landing, as in last year's fatal crash of an Asiana Airlines jet in San Francisco. Just 9 percent of fatal accidents happen when a plane is at cruising altitude, according to a statistical summary of commercial jet airplane accidents done by Boeing. Capt. John M. Cox, who spent 25 years flying for US Airways and is now CEO of Safety Operating Systems, said that whatever happened to the Malaysia Airlines jet, it occurred quickly. The problem had to be big enough, he said, to stop the plane's transponder from broadcasting its location, although the transponder can be purposely shut off from the cockpit. One of the first indicators of what happened will be the size of the debris field. If it is large and spread out over tens of miles, then the plane likely broke apart at a high elevation. That could signal a bomb or a massive airframe failure. If it is a smaller field, the plane probably fell from 35,000 feet intact, breaking up upon contact with the water. \"We know the airplane is down. Beyond that, we don't know a whole lot,\" Cox said. The Boeing 777 has one of the best safety records in aviation history. It first carried passengers in June 1995 and went 18 years without a fatal accident. That streak came to an end with the July 2013 Asiana crash. Three of the 307 people aboard that flight died. Saturday's Malaysia Airlines flight carrying 239 passengers and crew would only be the second fatal incident for the aircraft type. \"It's one of the most reliable airplanes ever built,\" said John Goglia, a former member of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board. Some of the possible causes for the plane disappearing include: Structural failure: A catastrophic structural failure of the airframe or its Rolls-Royce Trent 800 engines. Most aircraft are made of aluminium which is susceptible to corrosion over time, especially in areas of high humidity. But given the plane's long history and impressive safety record, experts suggest this is unlikely. More of a threat to the plane's integrity is the constant pressurization and depressurization of the cabin for takeoff and landing. In April 2011, a Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 made an emergency landing shortly after takeoff from Phoenix after the plane's fuselage ruptured, causing a 5-foot tear. The plane, with 118 people on board, landed safely. But such a rupture is less likely in this case. Airlines fly the 777 on longer distances, with many fewer takeoffs and landings, putting less stress on the airframe. It's not like this was Southwest Airlines doing 10 flights a day,\" Hamilton said. \"There's nothing to suggest there would be any fatigue issues.\" Bad weather: Planes are designed to fly through most severe storms. However, in June 2009, an Air France flight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris crashed during a bad storm over the Atlantic Ocean. Ice built up on the Airbus A330's airspeed indicators, giving false readings. That, and bad decisions by the pilots, led the plane into a stall causing it to plummet into the sea. All 228 passengers and crew aboard died. The pilots never radioed for help. In the case of Saturday's Malaysia Airlines flight, all indications show that there were clear skies. Pilot disorientation: Curtis said that the pilots could have taken the plane off autopilot and somehow went off course and didn't realize it until it was too late. The plane could have flown for another five or six hours from its point of last contact, putting it up to 3,000 miles away. This is unlikely given that the plane probably would have been picked up by radar somewhere. But it's too early to eliminate it as a possibility. Failure of both engine: In January 2008, a British Airways 777 crashed about 1,000 feet short of the runway at London's Heathrow Airport. As the plane was coming in to land, the engines lost thrust because of ice buildup in the fuel system. There were no fatalities. Loss of both engines is possible in this case, but Hamilton said the plane could glide for up to 20 minutes, giving pilots plenty of time to make an emergency call. When a US Airways A320 lost both of its engines in January 2009 after taking off from LaGuardia Airport in New York it was at a much lower elevation. But Capt. Chesley B. \"Sully\" Sullenberger still had plenty of communications with air traffic controllers before ending the six-minute flight in the Hudson River. A bomb: Several planes have been brought down including Pan Am Flight 103 between London and New York in December 1988. There was also an Air India flight in June 1985 between Montreal and London and a plane in September 1989 flown by French airline Union des Transports Ariens which blew up over the Sahara. Hijacking: A traditional hijacking seems unlikely given that a plane's captors typically land at an airport and have some type of demand. But a 9/11-like hijacking is possible, with terrorists forcing the plane into the ocean. Pilot suicide: There were two large jet crashes in the late 1990s - a SilkAir flight and an EgyptAir flight- that are believed to have been caused by pilots deliberately crashing the planes. Government crash investigators never formally declared the crashes suicides but both are widely acknowledged by crash experts to have been caused by deliberate pilot actions.

{"text": "(Reuters) - The disappearance of the Malaysian Airline System (MAS) (MASM.KL) jet could dent the national carrier's plan to return to profit by end-2014, equity analysts said. Flight MH370 disappeared early Saturday about an hour into its flight from Kuala Lumpur after climbing to a cruising altitude of 35,000 feet. MAS, which saw its net loss expand 171 percent to 1.17 billion ringgit ($359.12 million) in 2013 from 2012, could see a loss in bookings due to the missing airliner and some analysts believe it could lead to a change in management. \"We do not discount the possibly of changes to MAS top management, given the existing disappointing financial results and the severity of the current incident,\" Daniel Wong, equity analyst with Kuala Lumpur-based Hong Leong Investment Bank, wrote in a note on Monday. MAS officials declined to comment on any possible changes to management, saying their primary focus was to care for the families of the passengers on the missing jet. The latest incident is the second mishap for MAS after a Twin Otter aircraft belonging to MASWings, a unit of MAS, crashed while attempting to land in October 2013, killing two. \"This could last for some time, even months,\" said Pong Teng Siew, head of research at Kuala Lumpur-based Interpac Securities. \"There will be some apprehension among travelers whether they should take MAS flights in the immediate future. \"Passengers and regular travelers of MAS will watch carefully how the top management handles this crisis situation. It means a lot to the future of the carrier.\" DIFFICULT TURNAROUND MAS has been aiming to turn around since it last posted an annual net profit of 237 million ringgit in 2010, but loss-making routes and competition from budget airlines like AirAsia (AIRA.KL) have hurt the company. It is only recently that it started to see its turnaround plan gain traction after a series of corporate exercises that helped improve cash flow and cut debt. The airline also gained the support of its 20,000-strong employee union following an aborted share swap with AirAsia in May 2012. Eleven out of 12 analysts who cover the stock have either a strong sell or sell rating, while one recommended a hold, according to data compiled by ThomsonReuters. The shares have slumped almost 66 percent since 59-year-old power industry veteran, Ahmad Jauhari Yahya, joined the state-controlled airline in 2011. Malaysia Airports Holdings (MAHB.KL), the operator of Kuala Lumpur International Airport where the Boeing 777 last took off, saw its shares fell 3.34 percent to 8.10 ringgit. Shares of AirAsia remained unchanged at 2.52 ringgit a share, while long-haul budget airline AirAsia X (AIRX.KL) rose 0.62 percent to 81 sen.

{"text": "LATEST: Did the plane turn back? Mystery surrounds the identity of two passengers who appear to have used stolen European passports to board a Malaysia Airlines jet that vanished carrying 239 people, as the search for the aircraft failed to yield a breakthrough. The Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 was carrying 227 passengers, including six Australians and two New Zealanders, as well as 12 crew members. More than 30 hours after air traffic control lost communication with the jet, concerns are mounting over the possible security breach, as authorities in Southeast Asia say there's still no sign of the plane after the search resumed at sea. Flight MH370 disappeared about an hour after leaving Kuala Lumpur en route to the Chinese capital. A total of 153 Chinese nationals were on board, and anguished relatives camped out at Beijing airport bemoaned the lack of news on Sunday. The airline company didn't contact me, it was a friend,\" a middle-aged woman surnamed Nan told reporters, holding back tears, after finding out her brother-in-law was on the flight. \"I can't understand the airline company. They should have contacted the families first thing. I don't have any news. I'm very worried,\" she said. Vietnamese boats reached the scene of two large oil slicks detected overnight but found no sign of the plane, army deputy chief of staff Vo Van Tuan told AFP early on Sunday, adding search aircraft were deployed at first light to scour the area. See also - oil slicks sighted near where plane vanished The passenger jet slipped off radar screens somewhere between Malaysia's east coast and southern Vietnam early on Saturday morning. Azharuddin Abdul Rahman of Malaysia's Department of Civil Aviation said he \"could not confirm\" the existence of the oil slicks. \"The rescue operation continued last night until this morning...we have not been able to locate or see anything,\" he told a news conference on Sunday. Asked about the stolen passports, he said \"we are investigating this at the moment\" but declined to give further details. An Austrian named Christian Kozel had his passport stolen in Thailand in 2012, while Italian Luigi Maraldi lost his to theft last year, also in Thailand, officials and reports. Despite their names being on the passenger manifest, neither man was on the plane to Beijing. In Washington, a US administration official said authorities were aware of the passports issue. \"We have not determined a nexus to terrorism yet, although it's still very early and that's by no means definitive. We're still tracking the situation,\" the official said. Earlier, when asked whether terrorism could have been a factor, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said: \"We are looking at all possibilities but it is too soon to speculate.\" Flight MH370 had relayed no distress signal, indications of rough weather, or other signs of trouble. Both Malaysia's national carrier and the Boeing 777-200 model used on the route are known for their solid safety records. See also - FBI lends support to investigation A US company based in Texas said 20 of its employees were among the missing passengers. Thirty-eight Malaysians and seven Indonesians were aboard, as well as a range of other nationalities including the Australians, Indians, Americans, Dutch, and French.

If the worst is confirmed, it would be the second fatal crash in the nearly 20-year history of the popular Boeing plane. A 777-200 operated by South Korea's Asiana Airlines skidded off the runway after hitting a sea wall in San Francisco last year, killing three people.

{"text": "BEIJING X It was one of his first trips abroad, maybe even the first. Wang Moheng was just shy of his second birthday. His parents took him and two of his grandparents to the tropics of Malaysia, with its sunshine and moist air and blue skies. They said to other parents at our day care center, Were getting away from the bad air in Beijing for a while,  said Xie Yongzhen, whose son has been a playmate of Mohengs. Other families from the center had joined them on vacation, she said, but returned on different flights. They bid farewell to Mohengs family in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, with the words, See you in smoggy Beijing. The family of five was among 239 passengers and crew members to have vanished with Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, which left Kuala Lumpur early Saturday for Beijing but never arrived. People from at least 13 countries were aboard the Boeing 777-200 jet, with the 153 Chinese passengers by far the most numerous. Of those from China, Moheng was the youngest. The passengers bound for China represented a vivid cross-section of a nation in its fourth decade of a dizzying economic transformation: artists and corporate salespeople, foreign businesspeople and employees of technology firms. Many, like the Wang family, had been on holiday savoring the turquoise waters and white-sand beaches of Southeast Asia, a popular destination for Chinese. There was a Canadian couple living in Beijing, the wife originally from China, returning from a vacation in Vietnam they had taken without their two young sons, who were being watched by a grandmother at home. The plane also carried a few large groups, including more than 20 painters and calligraphers who had been honored at an exhibition in Malaysia, and Chinese employees of an American semiconductor company traveling to China with Malaysian colleagues for a work meeting. There were transients, people intending to just pass through Beijing. One was Paul Weeks, 39, a New Zealand engineer living in Perth, Australia, with his wife and two sons, one born just last year. He had been en route to Mongolia for an assignment with a mining and construction company. Im taking it minute by minute, his wife, Danica Weeks, told reporters in Perth. I cant think beyond the minute. Ive got two young kids, and I have a 3-year-old asking, When is Daddy going to Skype? Relatives and friends of many of the Chinese passengers waited all of Sunday in a hotel ballroom in Beijing. Over and over, they asked Malaysia Airlines employees what had happened to their loved ones, only to get the same answer: No one knows. A manager at Malaysia Airlines, Ignatius Ong, told reporters that 93 airline employees had arrived in Beijing to give assistance to the families. He said the airline would soon fly some of the family members to Malaysia. Many of the relatives had no passports, and by Sunday evening, they were filling out passport applications. The frustration built. One man in the hotel showed a petition with more than 100 signatures to reporters, saying they were from relatives and friends who demanded more information. We have been pushed to the point of helplessness by Malaysia Airlines, he said. People dealt with their anxiety in different ways. Ms. Xie, who knew young Moheng from the day care, said she was going to the Lama Temple in the city center to burn incense sticks and pray for him and his family. Everyone is in deep shock and praying for a miracle, she said. Mohengs family was among the growing number of Chinese who are cosmopolitan in experience and outlook, and who can indulge in the occasional exotic vacation. Wang Rui, the toddlers father, worked in the Beijing office of Boston Consulting Group, an American company, and went by Rory. He was a graduate of the accounting program at Tsinghua University in Beijing and of the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. The boys mother, Jiao Weiwei, worked at a Chinese software company. Her parents were also on the plane. I really cant believe this, one of the familys neighbors, Hao Jingyu, wrote on her microblog. As long as there is a silver lining of hope, well keep praying. Among the many others in Beijing waiting for word were the wife and 10-year-old daughter of Maimaitijiang Abula, an ethnic Uighur painter and art teacher from the desert oasis town of Kashgar. The family had been living in Beijing for the past two years while Mr. Abula, 35, studied here at the Chinese Academy of Oil Painting. He was traveling in the group of more than 20 Chinese calligraphers and painters honored at an exhibition at the Malaysian Oriental Arts Center in Kuala Lumpur. She just cant accept it, a friend, Kuerbanjiang Saimaiti, said on Sunday of Mr. Abulas wife. Theres no information at all at this moment. Mr. Abula was proud of his hometown, in the far west, and had done interpretation there for a state television film crew led by Mr. Saimaiti when they were shooting a documentary in 2010. Mr. Abula had joined the Chinese Communist Party and was often teased for it by friends. But he insisted he did not want to become an official, Mr. Saimaiti said, and he was a responsible and kind artist. Mr. Abula had just won an award in Malaysia and posted a photograph of it online. In an upscale apartment compound in Beijing called Central Park, neighbors of Muktesh Mukherjee and Xiaomo Bai, the Canadian couple, wondered what might have befallen them on the flight. Ms. Bai, 37, was originally from China and a graduate of Beijing Foreign Studies University. Mr. Mukherjee, 42, worked for Xcoal Energy  and  Resources, based in Pennsylvania. They took frequent beach vacations in Southeast Asia, often with their two sons. The younger one, Miles, turns 3 in May. They also took romantic holidays without the children. In 2012, they flew to Rome and Greece to celebrate their 10th wedding anniversary. And this month, they had gone, just the two of them, to Vietnam on a beach getaway. That was how they ended up on Flight MH370. They were doting parents with two lovely boys, said Paul Haenle, who lives in their building. Ms. Bais Facebook page has photographs of the boys playing in the snow outside their apartment last month. She wrote, The first snowfall of this winter!!! The boys lie outside in the powder smiling.

{"text": "Three days of fruitless air and sea search for a vanished Malaysia Airlines 3786.KU +2.13%  flight left investigators with no concrete evidence of what happened to the plane or the people aboard. The search area was widened as frustrations mounted across the waters between Malaysia and Vietnam, where the search was concentrated, and in hotels where the families of the missing passengers congregated in Kuala Lumpur and Beijing. \"We are bewildered\" with the disappearance, said Hishamuddin Hussein, Malaysia's acting transport minister. Air-safety experts were equally stunned by the absence of floating wreckage. \"The lack of debris is more perplexing than anything else,\" said Bill Waldock, a safety expert and crash investigator who teaches at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. In almost any accident scenario, he notes, \"the floating pieces should be there, and they're not.\" Flight MH370, carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew members, vanished early Saturday after departing Kuala Lumpur for Beijing. The plane disappeared from radar over Malaysian and Vietnamese airspace less than an hour after takeoff. No distress signals were recorded. Planes and ships had chased down floating debris south of Vietnam's southern Tho Chu Island, but on Monday it turned out that the items weren't part of the plane. Malaysian officials said a pair of objects sighted by a Vietnamese seaplane before darkness fell Sunday weren't a composite inner door and a tail section of the Boeing BA +1.00%  777-200 as had been suspected. Vietnam searchers who had been using low-flying aircraft on Sunday released a photo of an object suspected to be an inner jet door, but vessels haven't been able to locate it. On Monday, Malaysia asked Vietnam to investigate an object looking like a life raft. A few hours later, Vietnamese ships secured the object and said it was a moss-covered cap of a cable reel and didn't belong to the plane. Vietnam also inspected an area 35 miles southeast of the city of Vung Tau, after a passing pilot reported spotting a large piece of floating debris, but \"we haven't found anything abnormal there'' said Lai Xuan Thanh, chief of the authority. Malaysia reported that samples taken from an oil slick found in Malaysian waters proved not to be aviation fuel, but fuel used in ships. Until the location of some wreckage is established, it's unclear which country has jurisdiction over the investigation, which could muddy things further. \"At this point, literally no one is in charge,\" said Jim Hall, a former chairman of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board. The failure of one sighting after another has forced investigators to widen their search to a radius of 100 nautical miles, up from 50 nautical miles from the last known position of the plane. Malaysian air-force officials said they would continue their search at night for the first time using aircraft with special capabilities. They didn't give details. Authorities also are searching in the waters on the other side of the Malaysian peninsula, to the west, because officials said Malaysian military radar indicated the plane may have tried to turn around in that direction. Investigators will be poring over civilian and military radar data to try to determine the path and fate of the plane, such as whether parts broke off at high altitude. Radar analysis could give investigators clues about where debris may have fallen. Analysis of radar data has played a major role in unraveling earlier air crashes; radars can record large pieces separating and show their trajectories. But some safety analysts said the Malaysian 777's high speed and altitude before its troubles may make radar tracks less reliable than usual. Pieces could be spread over a number of so-called debris fields, potentially stretching hundreds of miles. Flight 370 was roughly 100 nautical miles from the coast of Malaysia when it disappeared, a distance that could have made it difficult for radar to pick up the plane once its transponder suddenly stopped sending data about its altitude and speed. \"The farther the distance from the radar site, the less likely you'll be able to pick up that target,\" said Marty Lauth, a former Federal Aviation Administration controller. Aviation-safety experts said the area between Malaysia and Vietnam is relatively shallow, so it should be easier to recover debris than in cases over deep ocean. Martin Eran-Tasker, a security expert with the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines, said rescuers typically expect to find personal effects, shoes, seat cushions and other aircraft parts floating together, not isolated bits of random debris. The investigation on land found that five passengers who had checked in didn't board, said Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, director-general of Malaysia's Department of Civil Aviation. Those passengers' checked bags were removed before the plane departed in accordance with rules laid down by the International Civil Aviation Organization, the global aviation-safety regulator. Malaysia hasn't disclosed details about the five people. They checked in individually, a Malaysia government official said, adding that they aren't suspected of any crime. Mr. Hishamuddin, the acting transport minister, said that a statement by a previously unknown group describing the disappearance as the result of a political act didn't appear to be credible. The statement referenced last week's attack by ethnic Uighur separatists in China but stopped short of an explicit claim of responsibility. Malaysia deported 11 Uighurs to China in 2011 who Mr. Hishamuddin, then home minister, said were involved in human trafficking. In December 2012, six Uighurs seeking asylum in Malaysia were repatriated to China. The transfers were criticized by international human-rights groups. Mr. Hishamuddin said Malaysian investigators weren't ruling out any possibility, but Uighur attacks in China have been relatively unsophisticated in relation to what would be needed to take down an airliner. The families of the MH370 passengers in Kuala Lumpur huddled in conference rooms at a hotel. Selamat Omar, a 60-year-old Malaysian whose son was on the missing aircraft, prepared himself for bad news. \"I am sad, but as a Muslim I accept what has happened,\" he said as he waited for news of his 29-year-old son, Mohamad Khirul Amri, a passenger employed by a private jet company as an engineer.

{"text": "KUALA LUMPUR/PHU QUOC ISLAND, Vietnam - The disappearance of a Malaysian jetliner is an \"unprecedented aviation mystery\", a senior official said on Monday, with a massive air and sea search now in its third day failing to find any confirmed trace of the plane or 239 people aboard. The head of Malaysia's Civil Aviation Authority, Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, said a hijacking could not be ruled out as investigators explore all theories for the loss of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 en route to Beijing. \"Unfortunately we have not found anything that appears to be objects from the aircraft, let alone the aircraft,\" he told a news conference. \"As far as we are concerned, we have to find the aircraft, we have to find a piece of the aircraft if possible.\" As dozens of ships and aircraft from seven countries scour the seas around Malaysia and south of Vietnam, questions mounted over possible security lapses and whether a bomb or hijacking could have brought down the Boeing airliner. Interpol confirmed on Sunday at least two passengers used stolen passports and said it was checking whether others aboard had used false identity documents. Flight MH370 disappeared from radar screens in the early hours of Saturday, about an hour into its flight from Kuala Lumpur, after climbing to a cruising altitude of 35,000 ft (10,670 metres). A Vietnamese navy plane reported seeing what could have been a piece of the aircraft as darkness fell across the Gulf of Thailand and South China Sea on Sunday, but ships and aircraft returning in daylight have so far found nothing. Underlining the lack of hard information about the plane's fate, a US Navy P-3 aircraft capable of covering 1,500 sq miles every hour was sweeping the northern part of the Strait of Malacca on Monday, on the other side of the Malay peninsula from where the last contact with MH370 was made. \"Our aircraft are able to clearly detect small debris in the water, but so far it has all been trash or wood,\" said US 7th Fleet spokesman Commander William Marks in an emailed statement. Shares in Malaysia Airlines fell as much as 18 percent to a record low on Monday morning. NO DISTRESS SIGNAL No distress signal was sent from the lost plane, which experts said suggested a sudden catastrophic failure or explosion, but Malaysia's air force chief said radar tracking showed it may have turned back from its scheduled route before it disappeared. A senior source involved in preliminary investigations in Malaysia said the failure to quickly find any debris indicated the plane may have broken up mid-flight, which could disperse wreckage over a very wide area. \"The fact that we are unable to find any debris so far appears to indicate that the aircraft is likely to have disintegrated at around 35,000 feet,\" said the source. Asked about the possibility of an explosion, such as a bomb, the source said there was no evidence yet of foul play and that the aircraft could have broken up due to mechanical causes. Still, the source said the closest parallels were the explosion on board an Air India jetliner in 1985 when it was over the Atlantic Ocean and the Lockerbie air disaster in 1988. Both planes were cruising at around 31,000 feet when bombs exploded on board. The United States extensively reviewed imagery taken by American spy satellites for evidence of a mid-air explosion, but saw none, a U.S. government source said. The source described U.S. satellite coverage of the region as thorough. Boeing declined to comment and referred to its brief earlier statement that said it was monitoring the situation. The Boeing 777 has one of the best safety records of any commercial aircraft in service. Its only previous fatal crash came on July 6 last year when Asiana Airlines flight 214 struck a seawall on landing in San Francisco, killing three people. MASSIVE SEARCH About two-thirds of the 227 passengers and 12 crew now presumed to have died aboard the plane were Chinese. The airline said other passengers included 38 Malaysians, seven Indonesians, six Australians, five Indians, four French and three Americans. The passenger manifest issued by the airline included the names of two Europeans - Austrian Christian Kozel and Italian Luigi Maraldi - who were not on the plane. Their passports had been stolen in Thailand during the past two years. An Interpol spokeswoman said a check of all documents used to board the plane had revealed more \"suspect passports\", which were being investigated. \"Whilst it is too soon to speculate about any connection between these stolen passports and the missing plane, it is clearly of great concern that any passenger was able to board an international flight using a stolen passport listed in Interpol's databases,\" Interpol Secretary General Ronald Noble said. Malaysia's state news agency quoted Home Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi as saying the two passengers using the stolen European passports were of Asian appearance, and criticised the border officials who let them through. \"I am still perturbed. Can't these immigration officials think? Italian and Austrian but with Asian faces,\" he was quoted as saying late on Sunday. A European diplomat in Kuala Lumpur cautioned that the Malaysian capital was an Asian hub for illegal migrants, many of whom used false documents and complex routes including via Beijing or West Africa to reach a final destination in Europe. \"You shouldn't automatically think that the fact there were two people on the plane with false passports had anything to do with the disappearance of the plane,\" the diplomat said. \"The more you know about the role of Kuala Lumpur in this chain, the more doubtful you are of the chances of a linkage.\"", "label": {"what": ["The disappearance of a Malaysian jetliner is an unprecedented aviation mystery, a senior official said on Monday, with a massive air and sea search now in its third day failing to find any confirmed trace of the plane or 239 people aboard", "Unfortunately we have not found anything that appears to be objects from the aircraft, let alone the aircraft, he told a news conference"], "when": ["in its third day", "on Sunday", "in the early hours of Saturday", "on Monday", "every hour", "on Monday morning", "so far", "when bombs exploded on board", "late on Sunday", "too soon to speculate"], "where": ["Malaysia Airlines", "Malaysia", "Beijing", "a news conference", "the seas around Malaysia and south of Vietnam", "at around 35,000 feet", "from Kuala Lumpur", "from Kuala Lumpur", "turned back from its scheduled route", "over a very wide area", "around 31,000 feet", "in San Francisco", "on the plane", "an Asian hub for illegal migrants"], "why": ["investigators explore all theories for the loss of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 en route to Beijing", "at least two passengers used stolen passports and said it was checking whether others aboard had used false identity documents", "Underlining the lack of hard information about the plane's fate, a US Navy P-3 aircraft capable of covering 1,500 sq miles every hour was sweeping the northern part of the Strait of Malacca on Monday, on the other side of the Malay peninsula from where the last contact with MH370 was made", "the aircraft could have broken up due to mechanical causes"], "who": ["a senior official", "The head of Malaysia's Civil Aviation Authority, Azharuddin Abdul Rahman", "dozens of ships and aircraft from seven countries scour the seas around Malaysia and south of Vietnam", "William Marks", "Malaysia Airlines", "The airline said other passengers included 38 Malaysians, seven Indonesians, six Australians, five Indians, four French and three Americans", "Interpol Secretary General Ronald Noble"], "how": ["a hijacking could not be ruled out as investigators explore all theories for the loss", "The United States extensively reviewed imagery taken by American spy satellites for evidence of a mid-air explosion, but saw none, a U.S. government source said"], "damages": ["NO DISTRESS SIGNAL No distress signal was sent from the lost plane, which experts said suggested a sudden catastrophic failure or explosion, but Malaysia's air force chief said radar tracking showed it may have turned back from its scheduled route before it disappeared", "Its only previous fatal crash came on July 6 last year when Asiana Airlines flight 214 struck a seawall on landing in San Francisco, killing three people"], "countermeasures": ["a massive air and sea search", "we have to find the aircraft, we have to find a piece of the aircraft if possible", "No distress signal was sent from the lost plane, which experts said suggested a sudden catastrophic failure or explosion"]}}
{"text": "It would be an understatement to say that Pakistan is under attack. This week, the Pakistani Taliban bypassed all security checks at the country's largest airport in southern port city of Karachi. A few hours earlier, another affiliate of the Pakistani Taliban massacred nearly 30 members of Pakistan's minority Shiite community in Balochistan province. A few hours after the Karachi airport was reclaimed by Pakistan's security agencies, a suicide bomber rammed a truck into a military checkpoint in North Waziristan, close to the Afghanistan border, killing at least three soldiers. The attack on Karachi's international airport resulted in the deaths of 29 people, including security personnel. The bodies of another seven cargo workers were recovered Tuesday from a cold storage facility at the airport. All 10 terrorists died during the assault. Even after those attacks, for the second time in two days, Pakistan's largest and busiest airport was forced to shut down after militants launched a brazen attack on airport security forces. Tuesday's assault targeted the Airport Security Forces academy near Karachi's Jinnah International Airport, the airport's manager told CNN's Saima Mohsin in Karachi. The attackers fled, and no one was killed in the attack, officials said. The obvious question is: How did the militants manage to enter the airport premises with heavy arms and ammunition? Major security lapses This security lapse however is not new. In 2009, militants breached an otherwise impregnable fortress -- the General Headquarters of the Army in Rawalpindi -- and continued their operation for hours. Similarly, the Pakistani Taliban also attacked Karachi's naval base in 2011, destroying expensive equipment and killing 10 soldiers. In 2012, they were also successful in carrying out suicide attacks at Peshawar's International airport, resulting in more loss of life. Despite these major lapses, Pakistan's system of intelligence gathering and sharing has been reformed. The new internal security policy, agreed in December 2013, aims to centralize the intelligence sharing process, but it is yet to be implemented. In the case of the Karachi airport attack, the military's swift response helped salvage the situation. Within five to seven hours the airport had been cleared and, given the high-value targets there, major damage was prevented. Military seizes initiative Another key feature of the operation was the decisive role of the military, as the civilian government apparently took a backseat. Under Pakistan's constitution, federal ministries are responsible for aviation and airport administration, but the ministers were nowhere to be seen. Even in terms of media management, the military seized the initiative as the head of inter services public relations (ISPR), a major general, was live tweeting and informing about the progress of the operations. In any other country this would not seem extraordinary. But, given Pakistan's peculiar history and the recent civil-military tensions, these developments were meaningful. There was a clear public message that the Army was at the forefront and in control of security policy and operations. Negotiations with the TTP In the weeks before the attack, Pakistan's civil and military branches of government had been struggling to find a way out to deal with the TTP. Formal talks with the TTP commenced in February 2014 but these disintegrated a fortnight ago. Concurrently, the military had been launching airstrikes and the Karachi attack came in the midst of policy shift in Islamabad. The airstrikes resumed after the airport attack was foiled. Since Pakistan's new Army Chief Raheel Sharif assumed charge in November 2013, the military has given clear signals of its intent to tackle the TTP militarily. The TTP is believed to have killed between 5,000 and 15,000 Pakistani soldiers including generals in recent years. Pakistan's Army did not suffer such losses in three wars against India (1965, 1971 and 1999). Civilian leaders are worried about the potential backlash of such military operations. What complicates the issue further is that some of the factions of TTP are in league with the (Pakistan-friendly) Afghan Taliban, and an all-out operation would hit them as well. The Pakistani Taliban are not in a position to take over the country. However, the three terror incidents in the past 48 hours underscore their capacity to launch attacks on multiple fronts. They gained media attention and reminded everyone of their cohesion, weeks after reports that the TTP was in disarray after a major faction split from the group in May. Is the TTP in crisis or cohesive? In its official statement accepting the responsibility for this attack, TTP cited the Karachi attack as a revenge for the martyrdom of its leader Hakimullah Mehsud, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike last year. Since then the TTP -- a loose umbrella of various militant groups -- has been in a crisis of sorts. Its leader Fazlullah reportedly operates from Afghanistan and, according to Pakistani official sources, gets support from the Afghan authorities. For the latter, Fazlullah's presence is a lever to get even with Pakistan for its purported support to the Afghan Taliban, who launch frequent attacks and are contenders for the power pie after NATO's drawdown in 2014. It is unclear if the recent attacks will lead to the emergence of a coherent policy and civil-military consensus in Pakistan. Civilians are afraid of the reprisal attacks; and the military is in no mood to allow TTP to continue killing its soldiers. And with the withdrawal of foreign troops, soon the neighboring Afghanistan may turn into an easier space for Pakistani Taliban and their affiliates. It is time for Pakistan to make a hard choice. In its strategic calculus, it needs to address mending relations with the Afghan government and viewing terrorism as a shared problem.", "label": {"what": ["Pakistan is under attack", "In the case of the Karachi airport attack, the military's swift response helped salvage the situation", "Within five to seven hours the airport had been cleared and, given the high-value targets there, major damage was prevented", "Concurrently, the military had been launching airstrikes and the Karachi attack came in the midst of policy shift in Islamabad"], "when": ["This week", "A few hours after the Karachi airport was reclaimed", "In 2012", "in December 2013", "a fortnight ago", "A few hours earlier", "for the second time in two days", "after militants launched a brazen attack on airport security forces", "Within five to seven hours", "In the weeks before the attack", "in November 2013", "in three wars against India (1965, 1971 and 1999)", "in the past 48 hours", "Since then"], "where": ["in Balochistan province", "Pakistan", "at the country's largest airport in southern port city of Karachi", "the General Headquarters of the Army in Rawalpindi", "in North Waziristan", "on Karachi's international airport", "at the airport", "in Karachi", "in Rawalpindi", "at Peshawar's International airport", "from the Afghan authorities"], "why": ["no one was killed in the attack", "Afghan Taliban, who launch frequent attacks and are contenders for the power pie after NATO's drawdown in 2014", "address mending relations with the Afghan government"], "who": ["at least three soldiers", "Pakistan's security agencies", "the Pakistani Taliban", "the military", "the civilian government", "the head of inter services public relations (ISPR)", "Pakistan's new Army Chief Raheel Sharif", "security personnel", "another seven cargo workers", "All 10 terrorists", "the Airport Security Forces", "the airport's manager", "the General Headquarters of the Army", "Pakistan's civil and military branches of government", "Afghan Taliban"], "how": ["Even after those attacks, for the second time in two days, Pakistan's largest and busiest airport was forced to shut down after militants launched a brazen attack on airport security forces", "Despite these major lapses, Pakistan's system of intelligence gathering and sharing has been reformed"], "damages": ["A few hours earlier, another affiliate of the Pakistani Taliban massacred nearly 30 members of Pakistan's minority Shiite community in Balochistan province", "A few hours after the Karachi airport was reclaimed by Pakistan's security agencies, a suicide bomber rammed a truck into a military checkpoint in North Waziristan, close to the Afghanistan border, killing at least three soldiers", "The attack on Karachi's international airport resulted in the deaths of 29 people, including security personnel", "All 10 terrorists died during the assault", "For the latter, Fazlullah's presence is a lever to get even with Pakistan for its purported support to the Afghan Taliban, who launch frequent attacks and are contenders for the power pie after NATO's drawdown in 2014"], "countermeasures": ["Even in terms of media management, the military seized the initiative as the head of inter services public relations (ISPR), a major general, was live tweeting and informing about the progress of the operations", "some of the factions of TTP are in league with the (Pakistan-friendly) Afghan Taliban, and an all-out operation would hit them as well", "address mending relations with the Afghan government and viewing terrorism as a shared problem"], "perpetrators ": ["a suicide bomber", "The TTP is believed to have killed between 5,000 and 15,000 Pakistani soldiers including generals in recent years", "a U.S. drone strike"]}}
{"text": "ISLAMABAD, PakistanPakistan launched airstrikes on Tuesday against hide-outs of militants in the tribal areas, as security forces repelled a fresh attack near Karachi's airport, two days after the Taliban's assault on the country's busiest air hub. Nuclear-armed Pakistan has retaliated against Taliban attacks with periodic airstrikes in recent months. But, after Sunday's spectacular assault on Jinnah International Airport, the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is under increasing pressure to abandon its policy of bringing the militants into peace talks and instead unleash a full-blown operation to clear out the Pakistani Taliban's stronghold of North Waziristan. Mr. Sharif met on Tuesday with the army chief, Gen. Raheel Sharif, who has repeatedly made strong pronouncements against militants since being appointed to the post in November. A statement from the prime minister's office said the meeting was \"to review the law-and-order situation in country,\" including discussion of the situation in the tribal areas and Karachi. Officials said the main item was deciding whether to give up on the peace talks with the militants and launch an operation in North Waziristan. \"Now I think everyone appreciates there is no time left,\" said one government aide. \"Every chance has been given to the talks.\" Washington has long pressed for such an offensive. Pakistani officials said they believe the premier is now moving close to ordering it. \"Where an operation is needed, it will be launched,\" Abdul Qadir Baloch, a senior Cabinet Minister, said before Tuesday's meeting. \"We will not keep receiving the bodies of our soldiers in silence.\" The Pakistani Taliban, who are formally known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan and work closely with al Qaeda, have been fighting the Pakistani state since 2007. The group has demonstrated its ability to hit some of Pakistan's best-protected installations. A State Department spokeswoman, Marie Harf, said on Monday that \"we believe the Pakistani government understands the importance of protecting all of its arsenal, including things related to its nuclear program\" and added that Washington has \"no reason at this point to think it's anything but safe.\" Pakistan's armed forces said on Tuesday that at least 25 militants were killed after aircraft pounded hide-outs in the Khyber part of the tribal areas. \"We need a sweeping operation,\" said Rehman Malik, a former interior minister under the previous government led by the Pakistan Peoples Party. \"We've seen these targeted operations and they have no result.\" Under the PPP government, such large-scale operations against the Taliban were launched in 2009 in the Swat valley in the northwest and the South Waziristan section of the tribal areas. North Waziristan is the only remaining tribal area where a military operation against the Taliban hadn't taken place. An all-out operation in North Waziristan is complicated by the fact that there are militants based there who are considered as \"friendly\" by Pakistan, as they fight only in Afghanistan, such as the Haqqani network. Pakistani Taliban fighters could flee across the mountains into eastern Afghanistan. The offensive also risks a terrorist backlash, including the possibility of attacks in Punjab province, the heartland of support for Mr. Sharif. The continuing violence in Karachi, Pakistan's biggest city on the other end of the country, showcased the Taliban's ability to strike far away from the tribal areas. Militants on motorbikes on Tuesday shot at a training facility and hostel for the Airport Security Force, a specialist unit. They didn't breach the airport perimeter fence and no one was injured, officials said. A search operation for the assailants was continuing. Flight operations, which had resumed on Monday afternoon, were briefly suspended again as Pakistani forces fought off the gunmen. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for both Karachi attacks. It also emerged on Tuesday that seven more airport workers had died as a result of the attack launched by heavily armed militants on Sunday, which saw a gunbattle at the airport that lasted some six hours. This news took the death toll from Sunday's blitz to at least 35 people, including 10 militants. The seven airport cargo employees died after being trapped inside a cold-storage facility during fighting between militants and security forces, officials said. Rescue workers finally broke through debris into the facility on Tuesday, more than 24 hours after the operation to clear the airport ended. The men had hidden there, but the facility was damaged in the fire that engulfed the cargo bay after militants hit it with grenades, officials said. \"It was difficult to get inside as parts of the building had caved in and we didn't have the equipment to clear the rubble,\" a Civil Aviation Authority official said. \"They died from suffocation, or were burned to death.\" It was only late on Monday evening, after local news channels highlighted the plight of the trapped men, that the administration brought in equipment to reach them, relatives complained. Shahzad Humayun said his brother, 42-year-old Tahir Ali, was one of those trapped inside.

Television pictures showed soldiers and ASF forces taking positions in an open area of scrubland that separates the airport from Pehelwan Goth, a notorious slum that police have long claimed is a haven for terrorists.

An ASF spokesman said there had been an exchange of fire with security staff at a checkpoint guarding the airport and no one was reported hurt or killed. The assault came as the army launched airstrikes in the country's troubled north-west, killing 15 people and destroying nine terrorist hideouts, according to an official statement. Speculation is growing that the Sunday night attack on Karachi's airport will prompt Pakistan to launch a major operation to dislodge militants from North Waziristan, an area bordering Afghanistan that has become a sanctuary for a host of terrorist groups.

{"text": "KARACHI, Pakistan   Gunmen in Pakistan attacked a training facility near the Karachi airport on Tuesday, forcing a temporary suspension of flights and triggering a brief shootout with security forces, just days after the brazen Taliban assault on the city's busy airport shocked the country. Security forces managed to quickly repulse the attack on the complex, which serves as a training academy for airport security forces, officials said. Pakistani television stations showed images of security guards rushing to the scene and frantically taking up positions behind buildings or earthen berms in the neighborhood roughly a half mile from Karachi's Jinnah International Airport. The Pakistani military said army troops were sent to help the security forces after the shooting. A spokesman for the Airport Security Force, Ghulam Abbas Memon, said about two to three gunmen tried to enter a training academy complex for the security forces from two different entrances. \"Our men retaliated and repulsed,\" the gunmen, Memon said, adding that security forces chased the men to a drainage ditch near the academy where another firefight ensued but the gunmen managed to escape. \"Now a search operation is under way,\" he said.

Tahir Ali, said two militants fired toward a hostel for female employees on the academy grounds and fled toward the nearby slums that surround the airport. \"We cannot take any risks and allow terrorists to get into our facility,\" he said, speaking on Pakistani television. He said no one was hurt in the incident. \"Whenever there is such an incident, we will react forcefully.\" A spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the shooting in a telephone call to The Associated Press and warned that it \"wasn't over yet.\" The Civil Aviation Authority, which is responsible for running the country's airports, initially said in its Twitter feed that all flights at the airport were suspended because the academy for the ASF was under attack but later reported that operations had resumed. The head of ASF, Azam Khan, said the media had blown the incident out of proportion. \"The aim of the attackers was to create a panic and we shouldn't be playing into their hands,\" he told Pakistani television. Tuesday's firefight came on the heels of a brazen siege by the Taliban who on Sunday night stormed a VIP and cargo terminal at the Karachi airport in an attack that killed 36 people, including the 10 Taliban gunmen. At least 11 members of the Airport Security Force were killed during that attack. Pakistani authorities were still discovering bodies from that siege on Tuesday morning. Airport authorities found seven bodies in a burned building at the Karachi international airport, and brought the remains to the city's Jinnah Hospital. They were charred beyond recognition, said the head of the Karachi Municipal Corporation, Rauf Akhtar Farooqi. The discovery of the bodies inside a cold storage unit in a burned building in the airport, roughly a day after Pakistani officials said the airport had been secured, is sure to raise more questions about security at the country's busiest airport. Pakistani media were reporting that the seven were airport workers who had hidden inside the unit from the fighting but got trapped and burned to death. The head of the Civil Aviation Authority, Mohammad Yusuf, said authorities tried to reach to the building that was on fire twice during the siege but both the times shots were fired on their vehicles. After security officials cleared the airport, they went back to search the building because there were reports of people trapped inside. The Pakistani Taliban has been trying to overthrow the government and establish its hard-line rule across the country. The government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has tried repeatedly to negotiate with the militants to end the fighting but those efforts have gone off the rails in recent weeks. The airport attack, coming against a high-profile target in a city vital to the country's economy, has raised questions about whether Sharif will continue to pursue the negotiations policy or choose a more aggressive, military response.", "label": {"what": ["Gunmen in Pakistan attacked a training facility", "A spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the shooting in a telephone call to The Associated Press and warned that it 'wasn't over yet'"], "when": ["on Tuesday", "on Sunday night", "during that attack", "on Tuesday morning", "a day after Pakistani officials said the airport had been secured", "in recent weeks"], "where": ["KARACHI, Pakistan", "near the Karachi airport", "on the city's busy airport", "roughly a half mile from Karachi's Jinnah International Airport", "in its Twitter", "at the Karachi airport", "at the Karachi international airport"], "why": ["the academy for the ASF was under attack", "to create a panic", "there were reports of people trapped inside"], "who": ["Security forces", "officials", "Pakistani television stations", "security guards", "The Pakistani military", "A spokesman for the Airport Security Force, Ghulam Abbas Memon", "A senior official with the Airport Security Force, Col.

{"text": "An Uzbek militant group operating in Pakistan's north-west tribal areas says it played a role in the attack on the Karachi airport earlier this week, suggesting increased co-operation between militant groups in Pakistan. The news came the same day the US ended a five-month pause on drone strikes in Pakistan with an unmanned attack in tribal region that killed three suspected militants, officials said. Site Intelligence Group, which monitors militant activity, reported the Uzbek claim on Wednesday, and it was also detailed on the militant group's website. \"We would like to emphasise that this martyrdom operation was carried out as the revenge to the latest full-scale bombardments and night attacks with fighter jets by Pakistan Apostate Army,\" the statement read. Militants laid siege to the airport in Karachi late on Sunday in a five-hour attack that ended with 36 people dead, including the 10 attackers. The airport assault shocked Pakistan. Gunmen on Tuesday then attacked a police training facility near the transport hub. No one was wounded in that incident, and the gunmen managed to escape, but it compounded the sense that Pakistan is struggling to deal with its stubborn militancy problem. The Pakistani Taliban initially claimed responsibility, with a spokesman saying on Wednesday that the group had worked with the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU). \"Our brother organisation, IMU, played role in the attack on the Karachi airport,\" said a spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban, Shahidullah Shahid, in a telephone call to the Associated Press. Pakistan's north-west region, particularly the North Waziristan tribal area which borders Afghanistan, is home to numerous militant groups which often work together, sharing fighters, money or expertise. The IMU was formed in 1991 with an original goal to set up an Islamic state in Uzbekistan. But it later broadened its ambitions beyond the country to the rest of central Asia. The US state department classified the IMU as a foreign terrorist organisation in 2000. The group's leadership is believed to be based in North Waziristan and has a relationship with both the Afghan Taliban and the Pakistani Taliban, according to the state department. Michael Kugelman, an Asia expert at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars in Washington, said the co-operation between the IMU and the Pakistani Taliban is not surprising considering the former's history of working with various militant groups to achieve its goals. The Pakistani Taliban teamed up with al-Qaida in the 2009 suicide bombing of a CIA base in eastern Afghanistan's Khost province. That ability to work with others is part of the reason the Pakistani Taliban has survived even in the face of military operations, American drone strikes and internal divisions, said Kugelman. \"The Pakistani Taliban has very ferocious friends in Pakistan.\" He said the IMU was a \"legitimate threat\", adding that the group has maintained a considerable presence in Pakistan and Afghanistan in recent years and has been actively trying to establish an Afghan haven, particularly in the Kunduz area in the north-east of the country. Two Pakistani intelligence officials said on Wednesday that a US drone fired two missiles at a militant facility in the North Waziristan. They said they did not have information on three people killed in the strike, but that they were suspected insurgents. It was the first drone strike by the CIA-led programme in Pakistan since Christmas. Due to stricter rules on the use of drones, diplomatic sensitivities and the changing nature of the al-Qaida threat, the number of drone strikes in the country has dwindled.", "label": {"what": ["An Uzbek militant group operating in Pakistan's north-west tribal areas says it played a role in the attack on the Karachi airport earlier this week", "increased co-operation between militant groups in Pakistan", "the US ended a five-month pause on drone strikes in Pakistan with an unmanned attack", "Militants laid siege to the airport in Karachi late on Sunday in a five-hour attack", "The Pakistani Taliban initially claimed responsibility, with a spokesman saying on Wednesday that the group had worked with the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU)"], "when": ["earlier this week", "the same day", "on Wednesday", "late on Sunday", "on Tuesday", "on Wednesday", "since Christmas"], "where": ["in Pakistan's north-west tribal areas", "on the Karachi airport", "in Pakistan", "in tribal region", "on the militant group's website", "the airport in Karachi", "in the North Waziristan"], "why": ["the revenge to the latest full-scale bombardments and night attacks with fighter jets by Pakistan Apostate Army", "stricter rules on the use of drones, diplomatic sensitivities and the changing nature of the al-Qaida threat"], "who": ["officials", "Site Intelligence Group, which monitors militant activity", "Pakistan", "the Associated Press", "Two Pakistani intelligence officials"], "how": ["including the 10 attackers", "The airport assault shocked Pakistan", "Gunmen on Tuesday then attacked a police training facility near the transport hub", "No one was wounded in that incident", "the gunmen managed to escape", "in a telephone call", "compounded the sense that Pakistan is struggling to deal with its stubborn militancy problem", "the number of drone strikes in the country has dwindled"], "damages": ["36 people dead", "shocked Pakistan"], "countermeasures": ["killed three suspected militants", "the first drone strike by the CIA-led programme in Pakistan", "a US drone fired two missiles at a militant facility in the North Waziristan"], "perpetrators": ["An Uzbek militant group", "Militants", "Gunmen", "The Pakistani Taliban", "the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU)", "a spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban, Shahidullah Shahid"]}}
{"text": "Uzbek militants fighting with the Pakistani Taliban say they carried out Sunday's deadly assault on Karachi's international airport. The Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan posted photos of 10 men in black turbans holding AK-47s who had sought revenge for military air strikes. At least 39 people were killed in the airport raid, including all 10 gunmen. DNA tests are being conducted on the gunmen, who officials in Karachi said appeared to be of Uzbek origin. The BBC's Shahzeb Jillani in Islamabad says the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) is a highly trained militant group, with bases in the North Waziristan tribal region. It works closely with al-Qaeda and Taliban militants and has previously carried out large-scale co-ordinated attacks in Pakistan, including one on Peshawar airport in 2012. In its statement the group said the Karachi raid was to avenge military air strikes in Pakistani tribal areas last month which it alleged had killed women and children. Sunday's assault was followed by a second gun attack near the airport on Tuesday, raising tensions in Karachi further. Gunmen shot at a security camp outside the airport perimeter but there were no casualties. The violence follows a major split in the Pakistani Taliban (TTP) and faltering peace talks between the militants and the government. Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan Insurgent group set up to overthrow President Islam Karimov and establish Sharia law in secular Uzbekistan Uzbek militants fled their home country in the early 1990s after a government crackdown In 1999 the IMU set up several military camps in northern Afghanistan from where it launched incursions into southern Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan in 1999 and 2000 When the US-led alliance invaded Afghanistan in 2001, the IMU announced its loyalty to the Taliban. After 2001 IMU fighters sought sanctuary in Pakistan's tribal areas Estimates of current numbers in Pakistan range from several hundred to about 2,000. Many fighters have married into the local community. Pakistan's leaders met to discuss security on Tuesday. The military have been targeting militants in the tribal north-west but it is still not clear whether a broader military offensive in the Taliban stronghold of North Waziristan could be given the political go-ahead. Local media said the meeting had authorised the army to carry out \"appropriate action\" against terrorist groups. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had pledged peace talks with the TTP during his election campaign. Talks began in March, but little progress was made and violence has continued. 'Brazen attack' Gunmen attacked an area of Karachi's Jinnah international airport late on Sunday, opening fire and hurling grenades. Security forces gained control following an overnight battle, and the airport reopened late on Monday. On Wednesday another body was recovered from the airport, bring the total number killed to 39, including the attackers. Officials said the dead man was an airport security force official. The Taliban have declared in statements that the wave of attacks will continue. Correspondents say residents in Karachi have been shocked by the brazenness of Sunday's airport attack. Pakistan has been fighting an Islamist insurgency for more than a decade, with the Pakistani Taliban the main militant grouping.

But now it appears everything has gone down the drain,\" he said.

PCB chairman Najam Sethi had in recent press interactions hinted at giving some good news to Pakistani cricket fans and supporters and insisted the board was making serious efforts to get international cricket back to Pakistan. Another official said the Sri Lankans had also reacted positively to the invitation sent to them. \"Now we have to start afresh and this incident also means that now when we go to the ICC meeting to sign bilateral agreements with different boards for the next five to eight years it will be hard convincing them to keep the option of playing in Pakistan open,\" the official said.

Airport strikes were 'revenge' attacks In Islamabad, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif chaired a meeting with security officials late on Tuesday to discuss how to handle the crisis as the escalation of violence raised the prospects of an all-out army campaign against insurgent strongholds. The Pakistani Taliban, a loose alliance of insurgent groups united by anti-state Jihadist ideology, said they had carried out the Karachi attack in response to strikes on their positions on the Afghan border. Adding an international dimension to the events, Pakistani officials said ethnic Uzbek fighters were behind the attack and a report by a Pakistani monitoring website quoted an Uzbek commander as claiming responsibility. \"Usman Ghazi, the leader of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), claimed responsibility for Sunday's terrorist attack,\" said the site, Pakistan Risk. The IMU is a group allied with the Taliban which has often carried out attacks alongside it. \"The Uzbek militant group, which has been based in Pakistan's tribal areas since 2002, describes the attacks as revenge for Pakistani airstrikes in North Waziristan on May 21 that targeted areas populated by Uzbek and other foreign militants,\" Pakistan Risk said. Earlier, the Taliban's central command also claimed responsibility for the attack. Taliban wanted to scare international airlines Pakistan's air force has periodically bombed Taliban hideouts in the ethnic Pashtun belt straddling the border, but has yet to mount a major ground offensive there. Security was tight around Karachi airport and the bustling city of 18 million people remained nervous after the twin attacks, though life seemed to have returned to normal, with shops and markets open and people going about daily tasks. \"It looks like the Taliban have taken over the entire country,\" said Mohammad Gulfam, who owns an electrical appliances shop in Karachi. \"What we want is that the army should carry out a big operation to clear out all the country, so that the public can get some peace of mind.\" The Taliban's goal was to scare off international airlines from an airport serving Pakistan's economic and financial nerve centre, said Imtiaz Gul, a security analyst in Islamabad, the capital. \"They (militants) came with a certain design to take an aircraft and passengers hostage and create a scene which would have lasted for many days,\" Gul added. \"It would have put Pakistan in the international spotlight. That would have meant that foreigners and foreign airlines flying to Pakistani should stop doing that.\" Sunday's assault all but destroyed prospects for peace talks between the Taliban and Sharif's government, after months of failed attempts to engage the al-Qaeda-linked militants in dialogue on how to end years of violence. The Pakistani Taliban are allied with the Afghan militants of the same name and share a similar jihadist ideology.

{"text": "A U.S. drone Wednesday fired on an area in northwestern Pakistan, according to two Pakistani intelligence sources and a witness. Details about what the drone hit and whether there were any casualties weren't immediately available. Northwestern Pakistan is home to loosely governed tribal areas near the border with Afghanistan, and the area is a base for foreign fighters and a place of refuge for members of the Islamist militant Haqqani movement. The drone strike comes just days after two brazen attacks on or near Pakistan's largest airport in the southern Pakistani port city of Karachi. Earlier Wednesday, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan claimed that it carried out one of the attacks -- the weekend airport assault that resulted in an hours-long siege and left 36 people dead, including the assailants. The claim was made in an e-mail that included pictures that the militant group said were of the 10 attackers. The militants said the attack was carried out with the Pakistani Taliban, which has confirmed that members of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan conducted the Karachi airport attack, Pakistani Taliban commander Abdullah Bahar Mehsud told CNN in a phone conversation. Mehsud said the pictures in the e-mail claiming responsibility were indeed photos of the 10 attackers. He said the Pakistani Taliban helped coordinate and provided material support in the attack. Late Sunday night, 10 militants stormed the airport's cargo area in a siege that left dozens dead. The Pakistani Taliban also claimed responsibility for that assault, saying the attack was retaliation for the death of former chief Hakimullah Mehsud, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike in November in North Waziristan. The Uzbek militants have not claimed responsibility for a second attack Tuesday on airport security forces that forced the airport, Pakistan's largest and busiest, to shut down. Tuesday's assault targeted the Airport Security Forces academy near Karachi's Jinnah International Airport, the airport's manager told CNN's Saima Mohsin in Karachi. Security forces told CNN that an unknown number of gunmen attacked the academy's entrance and were met with an armed response. The attackers fled, and no one was killed in the attack, officials said. Once again, the Pakistani Taliban, which is formally known as Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, claimed responsibility. \"This wave of attacks will be continuing in retaliation for the shelling and atrocities of the government,\" spokesman Shahidullah Shahid said by phone Tuesday from an undisclosed location. Shahid said earlier this week that the Pakistani Taliban would engage \"in a full-out war with the Pakistani state, starting on June 10.\" But the airport itself was safe Tuesday, Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority said. \"#Jinnah Airport is safe, #ASF academy is under attack,\" the aviation authority tweeted Tuesday. The Civil Aviation Authority said flights were temporarily suspended but later resumed Tuesday. By Tuesday afternoon, the situation was \"under control,\" military spokesman Asim Bajwa said. \"3 to 4 terrorists fired near ASF Camp, ran away,\" Bajwa tweeted. \"No breach of fence, no Entry. Chase is on, situation under control.\" Airstrikes killed 15 militants Hours before the renewed violence in Karachi, the Pakistani military launched a deadly assault targeting nine militant hideouts Tuesday. At least 15 militants were killed in the airstrikes on Khyber Agency, in tribal areas bordering Afghanistan, the Pakistani military said. A military spokesman said he could not confirm whether the airstrikes were directly related or in response to the airport violence this week. But it's those kinds of strikes that the Pakistani Taliban warned would spur more violence from their end. When the TTP claimed responsibility for Sunday's airport attack, it called on the government to end airstrikes -- or face more attacks like the Karachi airport terror attack. Apparently, the TTP followed through with its promise. History of terror The Pakistani Taliban has long conducted an insurgency against the Pakistani government. \"Their primary target is the Pakistani state and its military,\" said Raza Rumi of the Jinnah Institute, a Pakistani think tank. \"It resents the fact that (Pakistan) has an alliance with the West, and it wants Sharia to be imposed in Pakistan.\" The U.S. Justice Department charged former TTP chief Hakimullah Mehsud in 2010 for his alleged involvement in a 2009 bombing at the United States' Forward Operating Base Chapman in Khost, Afghanistan.

{"text": "On Wednesday, images surfaced of militants from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) driving U.S.-made humvees across the Iraqi border, into the Syrian province of Deir Ezzor. If real, the photos prove that the border between Iraq and Syria is now an open road for ISIS fighters hoping to establish a Sunni caliphate in the region. To the leaders of the extremist group, the battles in Iraq and Syria are part of a single, broader fight. Analysts say the financial and strategic spoils of ISIS's capture of Mosul and Tikrit could provide a significant, nearly unstoppable boon to its Syrian arm, helping turn the tide in the months-long battle for Deir Ezzor. \"The weapons and money that they're gaining through the takeover of Mosul and other areas in Iraq can be used not only to consolidate what they're doing in Iraq, but to send money back into Syria, both to their operation in Deir Ezzor and to push further into the northern part of country, Aleppo and Idlib, where they'd been operating but been pushed back,\" says Aaron Zelin of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, who studies the Syrian jihad. Since late March, Deir Ezzor has seen relentless fighting between ISIS and their main rivals for supremacy in eastern Syria, the al-Qaida-linked Jabhat al-Nusra. Control of the sprawling oil fields in the resource-rich province is a top priority for both groups; in April, the Carnegie Endowment estimated that Syrian oil sales, much of them from the province, are still hitting up to $50 million per month. Some of the oil from Deir Ezzor is smuggled to markets in Aleppo, implying that it transits through ISIS-controlled territory in Raqqa. Since its emergence in Syria in 2012, ISIS has been moving fighters, weapons and goods across the Iraq-Syria border. Between Hassakeh province, on the Syrian side, and Nineveh in Iraq, it has effectively dominated land routes since last summer. North of Deir Ezzor, \"the border has been porous for some time, and ISIS has been able to use it with impunity,\" says Aymenn al-Tamimi, a fellow at the Middle East Center who studies Syrian military dynamics. \"If they capture the province, it makes it all the easier for them to move freely between Iraq and Syria.\" The synergies of a growing presence in Syria and a consolidating base in Iraq have strengthened the group's hand, in both countries. \"The spoils from Iraq definitely give them additional military and financial resources to devote here. The tide of battle has turned to ISIS as they push deeper into Deir Ezzor.\" \"I'm not of the camp who says the border is gone, but it's definitely not well enforced at the moment,\" says Valerie Szybala, an analyst at the Institute for the Study of War who focuses on Deir Ezzor and the eastern provinces. \"The Syrian regime has little to no presence there, and they're not going to step up and do anything about this now. Iraqi security forces are not up to the task. The only bulwark against ISIS now is the Kurds [from neighboring Hassakeh],\" she said. \"ISIS really has a lot of freedom of movement right now. You can't [normally] just roll a tank from Iraq into Deir Ezzor through an official border checkpoint.\" For ISIS, the fusing of controlled territory from Deir Ezzor to Mosul is a major step towards its stated goal of creating a unified Sunni caliphate in the region. \"The conflicts in Iraq and Syria have long been fusing,\" says Peter Harling, the Damascus-based project director for the International Crisis Group's Middle East program. \"ISIS operates across the border and steps up its activities on one side when it feels either empowered or under pressure on the other. The frontier line is eroding.\" The organization, now considered more dangerous than al-Qaida by many Western officials, is run by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, a merchant's son regarded as the ideological heir to late al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. In Syria, ISIS has made the city of Raqqa its de facto capital, taking over the city last year. But it has struggled in recent campaigns to expand the area it controls. ISIS faltered its bid to wrest control of terrain from Jabhat al-Nusra and other rebel groups, and its attempts to implement an ultra-conservative form of religious law has been met with resistance from Syrian civilians. Women are now forced to wear head-to-toe Islamic dress when out in public, while cigarettes and Western products like Coca-Cola have largely been banned. Earlier this year, civilians in Raqqa began to protest after the reported hangings of Syrian journalists and activists, accused of criticizing ISIS rule. Across the north and east, the group's violent tactics both on and off the battlefield have made them increasingly unpopular. In January, ISIS emerged victorious from clashes against rebel forces led by Nusra and the Islamic Front, keeping control of Raqqa city. But the infighting forced it out of northern provinces and slowed its advance into Deir Ezzor. \"We've seen them do well in Syria before, in Idlib and Aleppo, and then there's backlash and they get kicked out,\" Zelin says. \"They have a lot of enemies everywhere. So far, because of the general destabilization in Syria and Iraq, they've been successful. But that doesn't mean they'll have momentum.\" For now, the group is claiming that it's already reaping the rewards of this week's Iraq advance. \"On Twitter, they've had pictures that they claim are American tanks from Iraq being brought into Deir Ezzor and inspected by their leaders there,\" Szybala says. \"They claim they are already getting benefits from the spoils of Iraq.\" The gains could push the Syrian army into action against ISIS. Analysts say that Iran, President Bashar al-Assad's most important regional ally, is insisting that he take action. Iran, a Shiite power, and ISIS, a Sunni insurgency, have rival goals in the power battle of Syria's war. Szybala says there are signs the regime is beginning to take on ISIS, attacking the group's strongholds in Raqqa and Hassakah earlier this week. \"If that's really happening, I don't think it's just for show,\" Szybala says. I think it's probably because this is [partly] Iran's game, and now that ISIS is proving itself to have real military power and to be a trans-national threat, Iran can't afford that and would be pushing the regime to finally take action. ISIS is acting like an army now.\"", "label": {"what": ["militants from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) driving U.S.-made humvees across the Iraqi border", "Deir Ezzor has seen relentless fighting between ISIS and their main rivals", "Some of the oil from Deir Ezzor is smuggled to markets in Aleppo", "ISIS has been moving fighters, weapons and goods across the Iraq-Syria border", "it has effectively dominated land routes", "ISIS has made the city of Raqqa its de facto capital", "implement an ultra-conservative form of religious law", "ISIS emerged victorious from clashes against rebel forces led by Nusra and the Islamic Front", "keeping control of Raqqa city", "reaping the rewards of this week's Iraq advance", "American tanks from Iraq being brought into Deir Ezzor and inspected by their leaders"], "when": ["On Wednesday", "Since late March", "in April", "in 2012", "since last summer", "Earlier this year", "last year", "In January", "earlier this week"], "where": ["into the Syrian province of Deir Ezzor", "the border between Iraq and Syria", "into the northern part of country", "in Aleppo", "in Idlib", "North of Deir Ezzor", "Hassakeh province", "Nineveh in Iraq", "On Twitter"], "why": ["hoping to establish a Sunni caliphate in the region", "for supremacy in eastern Syria", "accused of criticizing ISIS rule", "violent tactics both on and off the battlefield", "because of the general destabilization in Syria and Iraq", "because this is [partly] Iran's game"], "who": ["Analysts", "Aaron Zelin of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, who studies the Syrian jihad", "the Carnegie Endowment", "Aymenn al-Tamimi, a fellow at the Middle East Center who studies Syrian military dynamics", "Valerie Szybala, an analyst at the Institute for the Study of War who focuses on Deir Ezzor and the eastern provinces", "Iraqi security forces", "Peter Harling, the Damascus-based project director for the International Crisis Group's Middle East program", "Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, a merchant's son", "the ideological heir to late al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden", "civilians in Raqqa", "Iran, President Bashar al-Assad's most important regional ally", "a Shiite power", "a Sunni insurgency"], "how": ["gaining through the takeover of Mosul and other areas in Iraq", "through ISIS-controlled territory in Raqqa", "use it with impunity", "through an official border checkpoint", "considered more dangerous than al-Qaida by many Western officials", "acting like an army"], "damages": ["taking over the city last year", "Women are now forced to wear head-to-toe Islamic dress", "while cigarettes and Western products like Coca-Cola have largely been banned", "hangings of Syrian journalists and activists"], "countermeasures": ["the Kurds [from neighboring Hassakeh]", "resistance from Syrian civilians", "began to protest", "the Syrian army into action against ISIS", "the regime is beginning to take on ISIS", "attacking the group's strongholds in Raqqa and Hassakah"], "perpetrators": ["militants from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS)", "ISIS fighters", "the leaders of the extremist group", "Jabhat al-Nusra", "other rebel groups"]}}
{"text": "Long before it looted the Iraqi central bank in Mosul of $429 million, the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant/Syria (ISIS) was well-funded in its quest to establish a Shariah caliphate, thanks to a raging criminal enterprise of extortion, bank robbery and petty theft, as well as donations from well-heeled sponsors throughout the Arab world, according to experts. The latest payday  gained when the jihadist group led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi overran Iraq's second largest city and emptied the vaults of cash and gold bullion  swelled already healthy coffers and made ISIS, by some estimations, the world's richest terrorist organization. The group also seized U.S.-made tanks, Blackhawk helicopters, cargo planes and an unknown quantity of guns, all part of a $14 billion arsenal the U.S. sold or donated to the beleaguered Iraqi security forces. The money and weapons are already helping ISIS in its ferocious bid to carve out a nation governed by strict and merciless Shariah law in northern Iraq and northwestern Syria. The group already sees itself as an independent state with large swaths of the two battle-scarred nations, areas it now controls and is bent on expanding. The \"Levant\" incorporated into the group's name historically refers to an eastern Mediterranean area that also includes parts of Lebanon, Israel, Jordan and Cypus, though it's unclear exactly what territory the organization has designs on. \"As they see it, they're a state and so they're entitled to tax the population in accordance with Islamic law and to use resources for the common good as long as they don't infringe on property protections specified in the Quran.\"\n- Aron Lund, Middle East expert Aron Lund, a Stockholm-based Middle East expert and author of two books on Syrian militias and opposition politics, said ISIS has long gotten funding from ideological sympathizers throughout the wider region. They also enriched themselves after wading into Syria's bloody civil war, seizing territory including oil fields and setting up border checkpoints where they make truckers pay tolls, he said. But much of their funding comes from what they consider \"taxes and voluntary contributions,\" but others likely consider extortion and protection money, Lund said. \"As they see it, they're a state and so they're entitled to tax the population in accordance with Islamic law and to use resources for the common good as long as they don't infringe on property protections specified in the Quran,\" Lund told FoxNews.com. \"And by the common good, they mean their war.\" Experts said it's impossible to gauge how many fighters ISIS counts, but as they roll through Iraq, terrorizing and pillaging the war-torn nation, the numbers are swelling. Lund said other Sunni rebel groups, alienated by Baghdad's refusal to include them in the mainly Shi'ite government, are joining. They likely don't pay their fighters wages, but they do need money to fund their metastasizing operation. \"When you have volunteer fighters who work for free and live ascetically, and you plunder weapons and ammunition out of government stockpiles, that cuts down on costs pretty dramatically,\" Lund said. \"But they still have expenses, of course, both military and civilian, including lots of local charity projects to win hearts and minds where they've seized control.\" Money trickles in to ISIS accounts from sympathizing Sunnis in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait, according to Jonathan Schanzer, a former terrorism finance analyst at the U.S. Department of the Treasury and currently vice president of research at Foundation for Defense of Democracies. \"In some cases, there may even be funds originating from shadowy Al Qaeda figures inside Iran, he said. \"This is complicated, to put it mildly. \"Apart from this traditional patron-client model, we also continue to see small-time criminal activity, including petty crimes and shakedowns where ISIS operates,\" Schanzer added. By some estimates, looting the national bank in Mosul made ISIS the wealthiest terrorist organization in the world. The website MoneyJihad estimates that the Taliban has between $70 million and $400 million under its control, while groups like Hezbollah, Hamas and Al Qaeda operate on far less. British-based terrorism blogger Brown Moses observed that ISIS' bank haul could \"buy a whole lot of jihad.\" \"For example, with $425 million, ISIS could pay 60,000 fighters around $600 a month for a year,\" Brown Moses tweeted. The entire cost to Al Qaeda of the 9/11 attacks has been estimated at less than $30 million. With plenty of cash and their ranks growing, ISIS is poised to expand the territory it already controls, from Raqqah, Syria, to the west to Jalula, Iraq, to the east. ISIS was known as Al Qaeda in Iraq until 2006, when it rebranded itself as ISIS. Its popularity grew in part out of opposition to the presence of U.S. forces, then swelled as the split between the Sunni sect of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein clashed with the Shi'ite administration led by current Prime  Minister Nuri al-Maliki.

{"text": "The 2,000 troops are now on the ground in Iraq's Diyala and Wasat provinces, a unnamed senior Iraqi official told the Guardian. It comes as President Hassan Rouhani said Iran was ready to help Iraq in its battle against Sunni Islamist militants. \"If we see that the United States takes action against terrorist groups in Iraq, then one can think about it,\" Rouhani said at a press conference marking a year since he was elected president. Both Iranian and American leaders have separately pledged support for the government of Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in fighting advancing fighters from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). \"We have said that all countries must unite in combating terrorism. But right now regarding Iraq we have not seen the Americans taking a decision yet,\" Rouhani said, mentioning that problems in neighbouring Syria have been made worse by Western support for rebels there. On Friday, US President Barack Obama said Washington was considering options over Iraq short of sending troops. \"We will not be sending US troops back into combat in Iraq, but I have asked my national security team to prepare a range of other options that could help support Iraqi security forces,\" he said. The jihadists, employing brutal tactics and showing no mercy for civilians and rival rebels, have taken a swathe of mostly Sunni Arab territory in northern Iraq since launching an offensive on Monday. Their advances and boast of animosity toward Shiism -- a branch of Islam overwhelmingly practised in Iran -- have raised alarm in Tehran, with the leadership promising to fight their \"terrorism.\" Rouhani said Iran is ready to help Iraq, if asked. \"No specific request has been put forward, but we are prepared to help -- within the frameworks of international regulations -- if there is a request,\" he said.

{"text": "It is one of the more intriguing twists of the Iraq crisis: the prospect of cooperation between the US and Iran in the scramble to bolster Nouri al-Maliki's beleaguered government against Sunni extremists seeking to set up an Islamic emirate. Hassan Rouhani, the Iranian president, has made clear how concerned Tehran is about the success of Isis fighters who have captured swaths of territory  even suggesting on Saturday that Iran might work with the US to halt their advance. On Sunday, however, the tone was markedly more cautious, with an Iranian official warning that \"any foreign military intervention in Iraq\" would only complicate the crisis. \"Iraq has the capacity and necessary preparations for the fight against terrorism and extremism,\" the foreign ministry insisted. It does look, though, as if Maliki can count on some discreet help. Qasim Suleimani, commander of the Quds force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, has been visiting Baghdad  though Tehran quickly denied this. Suleimani has been a key, if shadowy, figure for the last decade, pulling strings and lubricating links with Iraqi politicians and militias, some with long experience in fighting US forces after the 2003 invasion. The Brookings Institution, a respected US thinktank, reported over the weekend that Iran appears to have committed three battalion-sized groups of Quds force personnel  likely to be trainers and advisers tasked to improve the performance of indigenous Iraqi units, rather than to fight themselves. Suleimani also manages Iranian ties with the Lebanese Shia movement Hezbollah, vital in giving Bashar al-Assad the edge over the Syrian rebels fighting to overthrow him. Now another important client, Maliki, is in serious trouble and Tehran is being forced to defend him and century-old national borders that are being eroded by violent jihadis with potentially disastrous consequences for the balance of power across the region. Iran wields considerable influence in Iraq, though Iraq's Shia majority have good national and religious reasons of their own for fighting Sunni extremism: Ayatollah Ali Sistani, the community's spiritual authority, who is often described as a \"quietist,\" called for Iraqis to defend themselves against Isis. Tehran is sending out the same message: the Iraqi-born Iranian Ayatollah Mohammad Hashemi Shahroudi, who is close to Ayatollah Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, urged Iraqis to unite against terrorism. Ayatollah Mohammad Emami-Kashani, another senior Iranian cleric, gave part of his Friday prayer address in Arabic rather than Persian to express support for \"the great and brave people of Iraq\". US responses to the crisis have been more transparent but are hard to predict. Barack Obama's decision to deploy an aircraft carrier to the Gulf does not mean combat missions will automatically follow. Putting American boots back on the ground in Iraq seems unthinkable in the light of the president's instinctive wish to avoid new Middle Eastern entanglements  even when, as in the case of last summer's Syrian chemical weapons attacks, his own \"red lines\" and wider US credibility are at stake. Commentators in Tehran and Washington have argued that these old enemies share significant interests in defending the status quo in Baghdad: for example, both had urged Maliki to act more inclusively to stop alienating Sunnis for fear of empowering Isis. \"Iraq is one of those places that contradicts the popular notion that Iranian and American interests constitute a zero-sum game,\" the analyst Kenneth Pollack, a CIA veteran, commented on the eve of the April elections. \"There, what is bad for Iran is often just as bad for the United States and what they want to see is often what we want to see as well.\" Whether those common interests will extend to actual, as opposed to de facto, military coordination  US air strikes or drone intelligence in support of Iranian revolutionary guards, or Iranian-advised Iraqi units  remains to be seen. It is fascinating too to speculate whether any cooperation could impact on the ongoing talks on Iran's nuclear programme, a month before the deadline for a deal. Iraq's Kurds have been clearer in their approach to the crisis. The humiliating flight of the Iraqi army in the face of the Isis takeover of Mosul created a golden opportunity for peshmerga forces  the best-trained and equipped military units in the country  to occupy territory outside the provinces controlled by the Kurdish regional government (KRG), especially in the Kirkuk area. Erbil  in conflict with Baghdad over oil resources, revenues and territory  has certainly gained some handy leverage over Maliki. But the changes may be a mixed blessing. Aside from having to absorb huge numbers of refugees, the Kurds could face difficulties with their new neighbours. \"The KRG will not only have to secure greater territories and populations from extremist groups on its borders,\" the analyst Denise Natali warned in Al-Monitor, \"but also manoeuvre its nationalist agenda through radicalised Sunni Arab populations that may be even more resistant than Maliki and Shia groups.\"", "label": {"what": ["an Iranian official warning that 'any foreign military intervention in Iraq' would only complicate the crisis", "visiting Baghdad though Tehran", "have committed three battalion-sized groups of Quds force personnel", "century-old national borders that are being eroded by violent jihadis", "Iran wields considerable influence in Iraq", "Barack Obama's decision to deploy an aircraft carrier to the Gulf", "argued that these old enemies share significant interests in defending the status quo in Baghdad", "Iraq's Kurds have been clearer in their approach to the crisis", "The humiliating flight of the Iraqi army", "Erbil in conflict with Baghdad over oil resources, revenues and territory"], "when": ["on Saturday", "On Sunday", "for the last decade", "over the weekend", "after the 2003 invasion", "on the eve of the April elections", "a month before the deadline for a deal"], "where": ["in Iraq", "in Baghdad", "in the Kirkuk area", "to the Gulf", "in the country", "on the ground", "on its borders", "in Al-Monitor"], "why": ["to halt their advance", "to improve the performance of indigenous Iraqi units", "have good national and religious reasons of their own for fighting Sunni extremism", "to express support for 'the great and brave people of Iraq'", "for fear of empowering Isis", "in support of Iranian revolutionary guards, or Iranian-advised Iraqi units"], "who": ["the US", "Iran", "Nouri al-Maliki's beleaguered government", "Hassan Rouhani, the Iranian president", "Tehran", "the foreign ministry", "Qasim Suleimani, commander of the Quds force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards", "Iraqi politicians and militias", "The Brookings Institution, a respected US thinktank", "trainers and advisers", "the Lebanese Shia movement Hezbollah", "another important client, Maliki", "Iraq's Shia majority", "the Iraqi-born Iranian Ayatollah Mohammad Hashemi Shahroudi", "Ayatollah Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader", "Ayatollah Mohammad Emami-Kashani, another senior Iranian cleric", "Barack Obama", "Commentators in Tehran and Washington", "Sunnis", "analyst Kenneth Pollack, a CIA veteran", "peshmerga forces", "the best-trained and equipped military units", "the Kurdish regional government (KRG)", "the Kurds", "analyst Denise Natali", "Maliki and Shia groups"], "how": ["rather than to fight themselves", "in Arabic rather than Persian", "as in the case of last summer's Syrian chemical weapons attacks", "US air strikes", "drone intelligence", "through radicalised Sunni Arab populations"], "damages": ["captured swaths of territory", "with potentially disastrous consequences for the balance of power across the region", "the Isis takeover of Mosul", "huge numbers of refugees"], "countermeasures": ["work with the US", "Iraq has the capacity and necessary preparations for the fight against terrorism and extremism", "called for Iraqis to defend themselves against Isis", "unite against terrorism"], "perpetrators": ["Sunni extremists seeking to set up an Islamic emirate", "Isis fighters", "the Syrian rebels", "Sunni extremism: Ayatollah Ali Sistani"]}}
{"text": "Two days before Mosul fell to the Islamic insurgent group Isis (the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant), Iraqi commanders stood eyeballing its most trusted messenger. The man, known within the extremist group as Abu Hajjar, had finally cracked after a fortnight of interrogation and given up the head of Isis's military council. \"He said to us, 'you don't realise what you have done',\" an intelligence official recalled. \"Then he said: 'Mosul will be an inferno this week'.' Several hours later, the man he had served as a courier and been attempting to protect, Abdulrahman al-Bilawi, lay dead in his hideout near Mosul. From the home of the dead man and the captive, Iraqi forces hoovered up more than 160 computer flash sticks which contained the most detailed information yet known about the terror group. The treasure trove included names and noms de guerre of all foreign fighters, senior leaders and their code words, initials of sources inside ministries and full accounts of the group's finances. \"We were all amazed and so were the Americans,\" a senior intelligence official told the Guardian. \"None of us had known most of this information.\" Officials, including CIA officers, were still decrypting and analysing the flash sticks when Abu Hajjar's prophecy was realised. Isis swept through much of northern and central Iraq over three stunning days, seizing control of Mosul and Tikrit and threatening Kirkuk as three divisions of the Iraqi army shed their uniforms and fled. The capitulation of the military and the rapid advances of the insurgents have dramatically changed the balance of power in Iraq, crippled prime minister Nouri al-Maliki, allowed Kurdish forces to seize control of the disputed city of Kirkuk and galvanised a Shia fightback along sectarian lines, posing a serious threat to the region's fragile geopolitics. On Sunday Isis published photographs that appeared to show it capturing and killing dozens of Iraqi soldiers. \"By the end of the week, we soon realised that we had to do some accounting for them,\" said the official flippantly. \"Before Mosul, their total cash and assets were $875m [515m]. Afterwards, with the money they robbed from banks and the value of the military supplies they looted, they could add another $1.5bn to that.\" Laid bare were a series of staggering numbers that would be the pride of any major enterprise, let alone an organisation that was a startup three years ago. The group's leaders had been meticulously chosen. Many of those who reported to the top tier  all battle-hardened veterans of the insurgency against US forces nearly a decade ago  did not know the names of their colleagues. The strategic acumen of Isis was impressive  so too its attention to detail. \"They had itemised everything,\" the source said. \"Down to the smallest detail.\" Over the past year, foreign intelligence officials had learned that Isis secured massive cashflows from the oilfields of eastern Syria, which it had commandeered in late 2012, and some of which it had sold back to the Syrian regime. It was also known to have reaped windfalls from smuggling all manner of raw materials pillaged from the crumbling state, as well as priceless antiquities from archaeological digs. But here before them in extraordinary detail were accounts that would have breezed past forensic accountants, giving a full reckoning of a war effort. It soon became clear that in less than three years, Isis had grown from a ragtag band of extremists to perhaps the most cash-rich and capable terror group in the world. \"They had taken $36m from al-Nabuk alone [an area in the Qalamoun mountains west of Damascus]. The antiquities there are up to 8,000 years old,\" the intelligence official said. \"Before this, the western officials had been asking us where they had gotten some of their money from, $50,000 here, or $20,000 there. It was peanuts. Now they know and we know. They had done this all themselves. There was no state actor at all behind them, which we had long known. They don't need one.\" The scale of Isis's resources seems to have prepared it for the improbable. But even by its ruthless standards, occupying two major cities in Iraq in three days, holding on to parts of Falluja and Ramadi, and menacing Kirkuk and Samara, was quite an accomplishment. Social media postings throughout last week revealed the group's shock at its successes. Some posting showed extremists weeping with joy as dozens of Iraqi army humvess were driven through a sand berm on the border into Syria. Foreign jihadists, many from Europe, were among those who stormed into Mosul and have spread through central Iraq ever since. Most of their names were already known to the intelligence agencies which had tried to track their movements after they arrived in Turkey, then disappeared, initially across the Syrian border. But noms de guerre given to the new arrivals had left their trails cold. Now officials had details of next of kin, and often phone numbers and emails. Whether the intelligence haul can do much to reel in Isis after the fact seems a moot point, with the group having already wrought so much carnage in such a short time. \"We will eventually find them,\" said the Iraqi official. \"We knew they had infiltrated the ministries and the most frustrating thing about that flash [stick] was it only had initials. We are focusing on the initials that had the annotation 'valuable' next to them.\" Other names were clearly of lesser use, he said. They were marked with \"lazy\", \"undecided\" or \"needs monitoring\". More than ever before is now known about how Isis has gathered steam. The past week has also been an advanced education in its capabilities and ambitions. \"Now we have to catch up with them,\" the official said.", "label": {"what": ["Iraqi commanders stood eyeballing

{"text": "The Islamic militants who overran cities and towns in Iraq last week posted graphic photos that appeared to show their gunmen massacring scores of captured Iraqi soldiers, while the prime minister vowed Sunday to \"liberate every inch\" of captured territory. The pictures on a militant website appear to show masked fighters of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, loading the captives onto flatbed trucks before forcing them to lie face-down in a shallow ditch with their arms tied behind their backs. The final images show the bodies of the captives soaked in blood after being shot at several locations. Chief military spokesman Lt. Gen. Qassim al-Moussawi confirmed the photos' authenticity and said he was aware of cases of mass murder of captured Iraqi soldiers in areas held by ISIS. He told The Associated Press that an examination of the images by military experts showed that about 170 soldiers were shot to death by the militants after their capture. Captions on the photos showing the soldiers after they were shot say \"hundreds have been liquidated,\" but the total could not immediately be verified. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the ISIS militants' claim of killing the Iraqi troops \"is horrifying and a true depiction of the bloodlust that those terrorists represent.\" She added that a claim that 1,700 were killed could not be confirmed by the U.S. On Friday, UN human rights chief Navi Pillay warned against \"murder of all kinds\" and other war crimes in Iraq, saying the number killed in recent days may run into the hundreds. She said in a statement that her office had received reports that militants rounded up and killed Iraqi soldiers as well as 17 civilians in a single street in Mosul. Her office also heard of \"summary executions and extrajudicial killings\" after ISIS militants overran Iraqi cities and towns, she said. The grisly images could sap the morale of Iraq's security forces, but they could also heighten sectarian tensions. Thousands of Shias are already heeding a call from their most revered spiritual leader to take up arms against the Sunni militants who have swept across the north in the worst instability in Iraq since the U.S. withdrawal in 2011. ISIS has vowed to take the battle to Baghdad and cities farther south housing revered Shia shrines. Defences bolstered around Baghdad Although the government bolstered defences around Baghdad, a series of explosions inside the capital killed at least 19 people and wounded more than 40, police and hospital officials said. Security at the U.S. Embassy was strengthened and some staff members sent elsewhere in Iraq and to neighbouring Jordan, the State Department said. A military official said about 150 Marines have been sent to Baghdad to help with embassy security. While the city of 7 million is not in any immediate danger of falling to the militants, food prices have risen  twofold in some cases  because of transportation disruptions on the main road heading north from the capital. The city is under a nighttime curfew that begins at 10 p.m. In a fiery speech to volunteers south of Baghdad, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki vowed to regain territory captured last week by the ISIS. \"We will march and liberate every inch they defaced, from the country's northernmost point to the southernmost point,\" he said. The volunteers responded with Shia chants. On Saturday, hundreds of armed Shia men paraded through the streets of Baghdad in response to a call by Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani for Iraqis to defend their country. ISIS has vowed to attack Baghdad but its advance to the south seems to have stalled in recent days. Thousands of Shias have also volunteered to join the fight against the ISIS, also in response to al-Sistani's call. Armed police, including SWAT teams, were seen at checkpoints in Baghdad, searching vehicles and checking drivers' documents. Security was particularly tightened on the northern and western approaches, the likely targets of ISIS fighters on the capital. The city looked gloomy Sunday, with thin traffic and few shoppers in commercial areas. At a popular park along the Tigris River, only a fraction of the thousands who usually head there were present in the evening. In the commercial Karada district in central Baghdad, many of the sidewalk hawkers who sell anything from shoes to toys and clothes were absent. According to police and hospital officials, a car bomb in the city centre killed 10 and wounded 21. After nightfall, another explosion hit the area, killing two and wounding five. A third went off near a falafel shop in the sprawling Sadr City district, killing three and wounding seven. And late Sunday, a fourth blast in the northern Sulaikh district killed four and wounded 12. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. Suicide and car bombings in recent months have mostly targeting Shia neighborhoods or security forces. Psaki said in a statement that much of the embassy staff will remain even as parts of Iraq experience instability and violence. \"Overall, a substantial majority of the U.S. Embassy presence in Iraq will remain in place and the embassy will be fully equipped to carry out its national security mission,\" she said. Some staff was temporarily moved elsewhere in Iraq and to Jordan, she said. Secretary of State John Kerry called foreign ministers in Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Qatar to discuss the need for Iraqi leaders to work together. U.S. ships arrive in Persian Gulf The USS George H.W. Bush arrived in the Persian Gulf as President Barack Obama considers possible military options, although he has ruled out putting American troops on the ground in Iraq. Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby has said the move will give Obama additional flexibility if military action were required to protect American citizens and interests in Iraq. In neighbouring Iran, the acting commander of the Islamic Republic's army ground forces, Gen. Kiomars Heidari, said Iran has increased its defences along its western border with Iraq, though there was no immediate threat to the frontier. Iraqi government officials said ISIS fighters were trying to capture the city of Tal Afar in the north and firing rockets seized from military arms depots. The officials said the local garrison suffered heavy casualties and the main hospital was unable to cope with the wounded, without providing exact numbers. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to reporters. Tal Afar is mainly inhabited by Turkmen, an ethnic minority. Al-Moussawi, the military spokesman, confirmed fighting was raging at Tal Afar, but indicated that the militants were suffering heavy casualties. On all fronts north of Baghdad, he said, a total of 297 militants have been killed in the past 24 hours. There was no way to independently confirm his claims. ISIS and allied Sunni militants captured a large part of northern Iraq last week, including the second-largest city of Mosul and Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit, as Iraqi troops, many of them armed and trained by the U.S., fled in disarray, surrendering vehicles, weapons and ammunition to the extremist group, which also fights in Syria. The photos of the Iraqi soldiers purported to have been killed did not provide a date or location, but al-Moussawi said the killings took place in Salahuddin province. Its capital is Tikrit. Executions avenged ISIS commander death The photo captions said their deaths were to avenge the killing of an ISIS commander, Abdul-Rahman al-Beilawy. His death was reported by both the government and ISIL shortly before the al-Qaida splinter group's lightning offensive. \"This is the fate that awaits the Shias sent by Nouri to fight the Sunnis,\" one caption read, apparently referring to al-Maliki. Most of the soldiers in the photos were in civilian clothes. Some were shown wearing military uniforms underneath, indicating they may have hastily disguised themselves as civilians to try to escape. Some of the soldiers appeared to be pleading for their lives; others seemed terrified. All the soldiers appeared to be in their early 20s, with some wearing European soccer jerseys. Some of the militants wore black baggy pants and shirts, many of them had sandals or flip flops. Iraqi authorities appear to be trying to limit the dissemination of such images and other militant propaganda being shared through social media and to deny the militants their use for operational purposes. Martin Frank, the CEO of IQ Networks, an Internet service provider in Iraq, told the AP that authorities have ordered multiple social media sites, including YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, to be blocked. On Sunday, they tightened the restrictions further by telling network operators to halt traffic for virtual private networks, which allow users to bypass Internet filters. Internet traffic in several areas overrun by militants, including Mosul and Tikrit, was ordered cut off altogether, he said.

{"text": "The Iraqi air force struck back at the militant group ISIS, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, killing more than 200 militants, Iraqi state TV reported Monday morning. The air raids took place in Saqlawiyah, northwest of Fallujah, according to a graphic run by state TV. ISIS has been ruthlessly fighting to take control of Iraq and has apparently posted chilling photos on jihadi Internet forums seeming to show the executions of Iraqi security forces. CNN cannot independently confirm the authenticity of the images purportedly posted by ISIS. CNN is examining the terrain in the images, some of the signage on buildings in several of the pictures and the uniforms of the apparent victims. Those details suggest the photos are real and were taken in Iraq. A caption on some of the images reads: \"apostates heading to their hole of doom.\" ISIS, an al Qaeda splinter group, wants to establish a caliphate, or Islamic state, that would stretch from Iraq into northern Syria. The group has had substantial success in Syria battling Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's security forces. On Friday, a tweet on what was claimed to be an ISIS Twitter account claimed that its members killed at least 1,700 Shiites. CNN was unable to verify the authenticity of the account, and the account appeared to have been taken down Sunday. In a statement, the U.S. State Department condemned the claim by ISIS, also known as ISIL, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. \"The claim by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) that it has massacred 1700 Iraqi Shia air force recruits in Tikrit is horrifying and a true depiction of the bloodlust that these terrorists represent. While we cannot confirm these reports, one of the primary goals of ISIL is to set fear into the hearts of all Iraqis and drive sectarian division among its people,\" part of the statement read. \"Terrorists who can commit such heinous acts are a shared enemy of the United States, Iraq, and the international community. \" The militants' quick advance in Iraq has been helped by many Sunnis who feel that the Shiite-dominated government has marginalized them. ISIS seized Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul, last week and has threatened to march on Baghdad, Iraq's capital and largest city. But \"Mosul didn't fall,\" a defiant Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki told military leaders in Baghdad in a speech televised Sunday on state TV. \"The ones who have fallen are the politicians who have bet against Iraq.\" The Prime Minister said, \"We will not allow anyone to divide the Iraqi people.\" Al-Maliki called on his top brass and soldiers to march and fight against ISIS, while criticizing Iraqi politicians conspiring against their homeland and Iraqi soldiers who have refused to continue to fight when confronted by ISIS. \"We will march on every inch, with all our weapons, with all our will and faith, so we can liberate and cleanse every inch of Iraq -- from the southernmost point to the furthest point in the north,\" he exhorted the military leaders. Despite al-Maliki's bold statements, ISIS accumulated several victories across Iraq on Sunday. The northwest Iraqi city of Tal Afar fell to ISIS, according to Iraqi Gen. Mohammed al-Quraishi. Many Tal Afar residents -- ethnic minority Shiite Turkmen -- fled the fighting north toward Iraq's Kurdish region. Tal Afar is in Nineveh province, midway between the country's border with Syria and Mosul, north of Baghdad. Before Iraqi security forces lost Tal Afar, several mortar rounds landed on a busy area in the town and killed at least seven and wounded 33 people, security officials in Baghdad and Tal Afar told CNN. Also Sunday, ISIS gained control of two villages in Adhaim, in its first push into Diyala province, northeast of Baghdad. On top of that, Iraqi security forces and gunmen believed to be ISIS clashed near al-Khalis, about 18 miles from Diyala's capital, Baquba, al-Khalis police officials told CNN. Three mortar rounds landed near a recruitment center opened recently for volunteers to help the Iraqi army fight against ISIS. Baquba is about 37 miles northeast of Baghdad. Baquba is an ethnically-mixed city, though Sunnis represent a slight majority. Given Baquba's proximity to Baghdad, if Baquba were to fall, it could give ISIS militants three-pronged access to Baghdad -- from Anbar province to the west, Ninevah and Salahuddin provinces to the north and from Diyala province from the northeast. Meanwhile, on Sunday, CNN Senior International Correspondent Arwa Damon was in the Iraqi Kurdish province of Kirkuk, where last Thursday militants took control of two villages. She asked the local governor, Dr. Najmaldin Karim, whether the United States should launch airstrikes to help fight back ISIS. \"I think they know how to do it, but blanket bombing is not going to work here,\" Karim said, explaining that that approach ignores the fact that ISIS is too blended into the civilian population in Kirkuk and innocent people could die. But there should be targeted bombing in both Iraq and Syria, he said. \"I don't think anyone is safe from these people,\" said Karim. Partial staff relocation at U.S. Embassy Between 50 and 100 U.S. Marines and U.S. Army personnel have arrived at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, a U.S. official told CNN on Sunday. A U.S official acknowledged to CNN that the additional embassy security personnel being added include U.S. Marines who specialize in embassy protection during high-threat conditions. The U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003. American military forces ended their withdrawal from the country in December 2011. At the time of the U.S. drawdown, Iraq's leadership had agreed that a residual U.S. military presence was desirable, but the talks broke down over the prickly issue of legal immunity for U.S. troops in Iraq. The Obama administration had said any deal to keep U.S. troops in Iraq beyond the withdrawal deadline would require a guarantee of legal protection for American soldiers. But the Iraqis refused to agree to that, opening up the prospect of American troops being tried in Iraqi courts and subjected to Iraqi punishment. This week, President Barack Obama continued to consider options with regard to the situation in Iraq but ruled out sending troops into the country. On Sunday, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said that some U.S. security personnel will be added to the staff at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and other staff members will be temporarily relocated to consular offices in Basra and Irbil and to the Iraq Support Unit in Amman, Jordan. A \"substantial majority of the U.S. Embassy presence in Iraq will remain in place,\" Psaki said in a statement, and \"the Embassy will be fully equipped to carry out its national security mission.\" Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said that a \"small number of Defense Department personnel\" are augmenting State Department security assets in Baghdad. Kirby said that the relocation of some embassy personnel is being done with commercial, charter and State Department aircraft flights. The U.S. military can airlift people if the State Department asks for that, Kirby said. The State Department is warning U.S. citizens against \"all but essential travel to Iraq.\" The official travel warning says U.S. citizens in Iraq \"remain at high risk for kidnapping and terrorist violence.\" While that continues, Iran has recently entered the fray, according to a senior security official in Baghdad who spoke to CNN on Friday. That official said that in recent days, Iran has sent about 500 Iranian Revolutionary Guard troops to fight alongside Iraqi government security forces in Iraq's Diyala province. However, Iranian officials, including President Hassan Rouhani, denied reports that some of its elite forces are in Iraq to help bolster al-Maliki, a fellow Shiite. \"If the Iraqi government wants us to help, we will consider it,\" Rouhani said, according to an English translation of his remarks Saturday in Farsi by state-run Press TV. But, he said, \"so far they have not asked specifically for help,\" and added that Iran could give strategic guidance if requested. The Obama administration is exploring possible direct talks with Iran over the deteriorating situation in Iraq, two senior U.S. officials tell CNN. Both officials ruled out any type of teaming up with Iran because the United States and Iran don't have a lot of common interests -- other than a stable Iraq. The United States is wary of furthering Iran's already considerable influence in Iraq. The Shiite Iranian regime is al-Malaki's closest ally in the region. Additionally the administration is concerned appearing to team up with Iran would both alienate Iraq's Sunni majority and worry Sunni allies of the United States in the region. The State Department statement said the United States \"will do its part to help Iraq move beyond this crisis,\" and a senior State Department officer told CNN that Kerry spoke to his counterparts from Jordan, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Qatar to discuss the threat posed by ISIS. The administration has not yet determined what the mechanism would be for talking to Iran, the senior U.S. officials said. Ex-U.S. ambassador: Kerry should go to Iraq On Sunday U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham argued on CNN's \"State of the Union\" for more intervention in Iraq. The South Carolina Republican, a frequent critic of the Obama administration's approach to foreign policy, called Obama \"stubborn-headed,\" \"delusional\" and \"detached\" over his decision on how to react to the unfolding crisis. \"Time is running out to turn this around,\" Graham said. \"Get involved with air power. Stop the march toward Baghdad. Deal with Syria. But get a new government (in Iraq) in place as quickly as you can that will bring the Iraqis back together for a counteroffensive.\" Ryan Crocker, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq from 2007 to 2009, told CNN's Fareed Zakaria on Sunday that he thinks Secretary of State John Kerry should fly to Iraq immediately. \"We need the secretary of state out there in Baghdad right now,\" Crocker said. \"We need the President on the phone to the Iraqi leadership because the reality is the Iraqis are not in a position ... they were not in a position when I was there, they are not in a position now, to work out hard compromises on their own.\" The United States is the \"middleman among Sunni, Shia and Kurds,\" Crocker said. \"Ambassadors can go just so far.\" Crocker, now the dean of the George Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas AandM University, said he would support \"very carefully targeted airstrikes\" in conjuction with high-level diplomacy. \"We have got to help the Iraqis come together,\" Crocker urged, \"in a unified fashion to confront a common threat.\"", "label": {"what": ["The Iraqi air force struck back at the militant group ISIS", "The air raids took place", "ISIS has been ruthlessly fighting", "CNN cannot independently confirm the authenticity of the images", "the photos are real and were taken in Iraq", "The group has had substantial success in Syria battling Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's security forces", "CNN was unable to verify the authenticity of the account", "the account appeared to have been taken down", "we cannot confirm these reports", "ISIS accumulated several victories across Iraq", "Many Tal Afar residents -- ethnic minority Shiite Turkmen -- fled the fighting", "Iraqi security forces and gunmen believed to be ISIS clashed", "The U.S. invaded Iraq", "American military forces ended their withdrawal from the country", "Iraq's leadership had agreed that a residual U.S. military presence was desirable", "the talks broke down", "the Iraqis refused to agree to that", "Obama continued to consider options with regard to the situation in Iraq but ruled out sending troops into the country", "Iran has recently entered the fray", "denied reports that some of its elite forces are in Iraq to help bolster al-Maliki, a fellow Shiite", "Both officials ruled out any type of teaming up with Iran", "The United States is wary of furthering Iran's already considerable influence in Iraq", "The administration has not yet determined what the mechanism would be for talking to Iran", "U.S. Sen.

{"text": "ISIS, the brutal insurgent/terrorist group formerly known as al Qaeda in Iraq, has seized much of western and northern Iraq and even threatens towns not far from Baghdad. From where did ISIS spring? One of George W. Bush's most toxic legacies is the introduction of al Qaeda into Iraq, which is the ISIS mother ship. If this wasn't so tragic it would be supremely ironic, because before the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, top Bush officials were insisting that there was an al Qaeda-Iraq axis of evil. Their claims that Saddam Hussein's men were training members of al Qaeda how to make weapons of mass destruction seemed to be one of the most compelling rationales for the impending war. After the fall of Hussein's regime, no documents were unearthed in Iraq proving the Hussein-al Qaeda axis despite the fact that, like other totalitarian regimes, Hussein's government kept massive and meticulous records. The U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency had by 2006 translated 34 million pages of documents from Hussein's Iraq and found there was nothing to substantiate a \"partnership\" between Hussein and al Qaeda. Two years later the Pentagon's own internal think tank, the Institute for Defense Analyses, concluded after examining 600,000 Hussein-era documents and several thousand hours of his regime's audio- and videotapes that there was no \"smoking gun (i.e. direct connection between Hussein's Iraq and al Qaeda.)\" The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence concluded in 2008, as every other investigation had before, that there was no \"cooperative relationship\" between Hussein and al Qaeda. The committee also found that \"most of the contacts cited between Iraq and al Qaeda before the war by the intelligence community and policy makers have been determined not to have occurred.\" Instead of interrupting a budding relationship between Hussein and al Qaeda, the Iraq War precipitated the arrival of al Qaeda into Iraq. Although the Bush administration tended to gloss over the fact, al Qaeda only formally established itself in Iraq a year and a half after the U.S. invasion. On October 17, 2004, its brutal leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi issued an online statement pledging allegiance to Osama bin Laden. Zarqawi's pledge was fulsome: \"By God, O sheikh of the Mujahideen, if you bid us plunge into the ocean, we would follow you. If you ordered it so, we would obey.\" Zarqawi's special demonic genius was to launch Iraq down the road to civil war. In early 2004, the U.S. military intercepted a letter from Zarqawi to bin Laden in which he proposed provoking a civil war between Sunnis and Shia. Zarqawi's strategy was to hit the Shia so they would in turn strike the Sunnis, so precipitating a vicious circle of violence in which al Qaeda would be cast as the protector of the Sunnis against the wrath of the Shia. It was a strategy that worked all too well, provoking first sectarian conflict in Iraq and later civil war. Al Qaeda in Iraq, or AQI, regularly attacked Shia religious processions, shrines and clerics. The tipping point in the slide toward full-blown civil war was al Qaeda's February 2006 attack on the Golden Mosque in Samarra, which is arguably the most important Shia shrine in the world. Three years into the Iraq War, AQI seemed all but unstoppable. A classified Marine intelligence assessment dated August 17, 2006, found that AQI had become the de facto government of the western Iraqi province of Anbar, which is strategically important because it borders Jordan, Syria and Saudi Arabia and makes up about a third of the landmass of Iraq. In addition, AQI controlled a good chunk of the exurban belts around Baghdad, the \"Triangle of Death\" to the south of the capital and many of the towns north of it, up the Tigris River to the Syrian border. Thus AQI controlled territory larger than New England and maintained an iron grip on much of the Sunni population. In other words, the Bush administration had presided over the rise of precisely what it had said was one of the key goals of the Iraq War to destroy: a safe haven for al Qaeda in the heart of the Arab world. By 2007, al Qaeda's untrammeled violence and imposition of Taliban ideology on the Sunni population provoked a countrywide Sunni backlash against AQI that took the form of Sunni \"Awakening\" militias. Many of those militias were put on Uncle Sam's payroll in a program known as the \"Sons of Iraq\". The combination of the Sunni militias' on-the-ground intelligence about their onetime AQI allies and American firepower proved devastating to al Qaeda's Iraqi franchise. And so, between 2006 and 2008, AQI shrank from an insurgent organization that controlled territory larger than the size of New England to a rump terrorist group. But AQI did not disappear. It simply bided its time. The Syrian civil war provided a staging point over the past three years for its resurrection and transformation into the \"Islamic State of Iraq and Syria,\" or ISIS. And now ISIS has marched back into western and northern Iraq. Only this time there is no U.S. military to stop it.", "label": {"what": ["ISIS, the brutal insurgent/terrorist group formerly known as al Qaeda in Iraq, has seized much of western and northern Iraq and even threatens towns", "Hussein's government kept massive and meticulous records", "no documents were unearthed in Iraq proving the Hussein-al Qaeda axis", "found there was nothing to substantiate a 'partnership' between Hussein and al Qaeda", "there was no 'smoking gun (i.e. direct connection between Hussein's Iraq and al Qaeda.)'", "there was no 'cooperative relationship' between Hussein and al Qaeda", "most of the contacts cited between Iraq and al Qaeda before the war by the intelligence community and policy makers have been determined not to have occurred", "the Bush administration tended to gloss over the fact", "al Qaeda only formally established itself in Iraq", "AQI had become the de facto government of the western Iraqi province of Anbar", "Many of those militias were put on Uncle Sam's payroll in a program", "AQI shrank from an insurgent organization that controlled territory larger than the size of New England to a rump terrorist group", "AQI did not disappear", "ISIS has marched back", "It simply bided its time"], "when": ["before the U.S. invasion of Iraq", "in 2003", "After the fall of Hussein's regime", "by 2006", "Two years later", "in 2008", "before the war", "a year and a half after the U.S. invasion", "On October 17, 2004", "In early 2004", "February 2006", "Three years into the Iraq War", "August 17, 2006", "By 2007", "al Qaeda's Iraqi franchise", "now", "over the past three years"], "where": ["not far from Baghdad", "in Iraq", "western and northern Iraq", "the Golden Mosque in Samarra", "the western Iraqi province of Anbar", "Jordan, Syria and Saudi Arabia", "around Baghdad", "up the Tigris River to the Syrian border", "the 'Triangle of Death' to the south of the capital and many of the towns north of it", "western and northern Iraq"], "why": ["the introduction of al Qaeda into Iraq", "an al Qaeda-Iraq axis of evil", "Saddam Hussein's men were training members of al Qaeda how to make weapons of mass destruction", "interrupting a budding relationship between Hussein and al Qaeda", "Zarqawi's special demonic genius", "because it borders Jordan, Syria and Saudi Arabia and makes up about a third of the landmass of Iraq", "destroy: a safe haven for al Qaeda in the heart of the Arab world", "devastating to al Qaeda's Iraqi franchise", "provided a staging point over the past three years for its resurrection and transformation into the 'Islamic State of Iraq and Syria,' or ISIS"], "who": ["George W.

{"text": "Spanish police say they have detained eight people on suspicion of recruiting militants to fight in Syria and Iraq. They suspect the cell of trying to send people to join the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIS), a jihadist militant group. Raids were carried out in Madrid in the early hours of Monday, officials say. The cell's leader was once held at the US detention centre at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba after being arrested in Afghanistan, a statement said. Unconfirmed reports in Spanish media named him as Lahcen Ikasrrien, a Moroccan national who was released on his return to Spain in 2005 for lack of evidence. One of the seven other people arrested is believed to be from Spain. Another is from Argentina and the remaining five from Morocco. Police were also reported to be hunting the brother of one of the Madrid bombers. Attacks carried by Islamist militants on four trains in March 2004 left 191 people dead and another 1,800 people hurt. Spanish police have carried out a series of raids against suspected militants in recent months. A number of people were arrested last month in Spain's north African enclave of Melilla on suspicion of trying to recruit fighters for Islamist militant groups in Libya and Mali. Although Monday's arrests were not thought to be linked to potential domestic attacks, Spanish police are said to be stepping up security ahead of the proclamation of Prince Felipe as king later this week. Spain is, however, concerned about the threat of \"blowback\" from the conflict in Syria and the Sunni rebel offensive led by ISIS in Iraq, which has led to the capture of a number of towns and cities. At the weekend, a French national was detained by German police on suspicion of fighting for militants in Syria. He was arrested as he arrived in Berlin on a flight from Istanbul. Belgian police investigating the murder of four people at the Jewish Museum in Brussels are seeking the extradition from France of a militant who spent a year fighting in Syria.

{"text": "SEATTLE Amazon.com Inc. long-awaited smartphone, unveiled Wednesday, boasts features like a screen with holographic images, hands-free scrolling and software that can recognize merchandise and art through its camera lens. But it may be more like a mobile cash register, part of an Amazon strategy to boost sales of digital music, videos and merchandise from its namesake e-commerce site. At an event here, Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos demonstrated features the company hopes will distinguish the phone in a crowded market now dominated by Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. The Fire Phone, as it is known, has four cameras that can track faces to show images that appear to have depth similar to a hologram, and allow users to scroll through Web or book pages just by tilting the device. At $199 to $299 with a two-year contract, the phone being released July 25 undercuts Apple's equivalent 32-gigabyte and 64-gigabyte iPhone 5S handsets by $100 each. That is a potential advantage for price-sensitive consumers. Without a contract, the Fire phone will sell for $649 to $749, according to Amazon's website. The phone has a 4.7-inch screenslightly bigger than Apple's iPhonea 13-megapixel camera and earphones that resist tangling, among other features, Mr. Bezos said. \"We're trying to do something different and better,\" Mr. Bezos said in an interview. \"There is a group of customers who will find these features useful and adopt them.\" Demonstrating a feature called \"Firefly,\" Mr. Bezos showed how the device's camera and sensors can recognize merchandise, signs, music or television shows. \"You can take action in seconds,\" he said, hinting at the commercial applications. A user, for instance, could point the phone at a pack of gum and then order it. The user also could point the phone at a painting to learn about the artist and other facts. \"Commerce is the reason Amazon is getting into what is so obviously one of the most difficult markets, which is smartphones,\" said James McQuivey, a Forrester Research analyst. He said the phone \"will create such a tremendous commerce opportunity at any moment.\" Mr. McQuivey likened the Fire phone to Amazon's introduction of one-click checkout on its namesake website in 1997. \"That just made shopping online so much easier. Now you'll have that easy checkout right in your pocket.\" In another sign of Amazon's commerce strategy, the phone includes one year of free membership in its $99 Prime program, which offers free two-day shipping as well as online video streaming. The phone follows other Amazon devices introduced this yearthe Fire TV set-top box and a wand for scanning groceriesthat promise to make shopping easier and quicker. The Fire phone will work exclusively on ATandT Inc. The arrangement extends Amazon's relationship with ATandT, which also provides wireless service for Kindle tablets and e-readers. The move could help ATandT attract new subscribers at a time of intense competition among wireless carriers. To gain market share, however, Amazon will have to convert millions of customers loyal to iPhones or Galaxy smartphones who are under two-year contracts. That is a tall order, considering Apple and Samsung alone commanded 46% of the world-wide smartphone market in this year's first quarter, according to IDC. In the interview, Mr. Bezos sought to play down competition from Apple and Samsung. \"If we'd been talking five, six years ago, we'd be talking about a whole set of other players,\" he said. Amazon also will have to attract developers for apps. The phone will use a version of Google Inc.'s Android operating system, but won't have access to Google's Play store, with one-million-plus apps. The handset business can be very unkind; once-highflying brands like Nokia, Motorola and BlackBerry have seen their market share erode. With its tablet computer, Amazon has lost ground to rivals in the first quarter, falling to 1.9% share of world-wide tablet sales, from 3.7% a year earlier, according to IDC. One potential advantage for the Fire phone is unlimited photo storage on remote computers through Amazon's cloud-computing software. As smartphones have become many users' primary camera, photos can suck up much of the storage, leaving little room for new apps or music. Amazon shares rose 2.7%, or $8.76, in Wednesday trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, to $334.38. The shares have fallen 16% so far this year. Amazon has shown a willingness to break even on hardware, relying on profit from the services available through the devices. That is a strategy Amazon has used for its e-readers and tablets, hoping to entice users to buy more e-books and digital music and video.

{"text": "There are two ways to view the smartphone Amazon introduced to the world on Wednesday: It's either the latest in a long line of phones with fancy new features that some people will never use or a magic wand for shopaholics. The phone's most significant feature, called \"Firefly,\" employs audio and object recognition technology to identify products and present the user with ways to purchase the items through Amazon. Users can simply snap a photo of a book, for instance, and Firefly will offer up its title and author, give more information about it and provide ways to buy it through Amazon with a single click. Seven years after Apple's iPhone took over the category, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos believes there is room in the market for something different. Even with the dominant leads that Apple and Samsung hold, Bezos told The Associated Press in an interview, \"it's still early\" in the wireless device business. People change phones all the time, he said. It's not about taking market share right away, but making a phone that is ideal for a certain customer and hoping it takes hold. \"We wanted to make a device that's great for one person,\" Bezos said. \"It's like a certain person likes chocolate and another person likes vanilla. The customer can choose.\" While the new Fire Phone comes with some features that are practically industry standard  like a slim profile, a sturdy glass touchscreen, minimalist buttons and one camera for facing toward and away from the user it breaks new ground in other areas. The phone's Firefly object recognition feature can identify items and product names captured with the device's camera. It can also pull in useful information such as phone numbers, website addresses. The company has catalogued more than a hundred million items that Firefly can recognize and has tweaked the technology to recognize words and characters in a variety of real-life situations. Another feature, called \"dynamic perspective,\" uses four infrared, front-facing cameras that tell the phone where the user's face and eyes are located. The feature adjusts the user interface so that tilting the screen relative to the viewer's face can toggle through screens, scroll through websites, make online video game characters fly up or down, and render buildings and other custom-made art in 3-D. The entry-level Fire phone costs $199 with a two-year ATandT contract, which places it at the high end of smartphone pricing. But the phone comes with 32 gigabytes of memory, double the standard 16 GB. It also comes with 12 months of Amazon Prime, the company's free shipping, video, music and book subscription plan, which normally costs $99 a year. \"This is a very aggressive price point for a premium phone,\" Bezos said. The new device fits with Amazon's broader aim to create a more efficient shopping experience while steering more consumers to its retail products. \"It goes back to the mission of Amazon, which is to sell you stuff,\" said Ramon Llamas of the research firm IDC. \"It reduces the number of steps it takes to buy things on the phone.\" Fire also comes with a 4.7-inch screen, suitable for using with one hand, and earbuds with flat cords and magnets that are designed to eliminate tangles. Persuading consumers to buy the Fire over an iPhone or Samsung phone will be tough, analysts say, particularly because Amazon isn't offering price breaks the way it has with Kindle tablets. And sophisticated technology such as 3-D will appeal primarily to early adopters of technology. \"The technology's cool, but consumers don't buy technology,\" said Julie Ask, an analyst at Forrester Research. \"We buy solutions. We buy services. We pay for things that make our lives easier.\" Charles Golvin, founder of Abelian Research, believes the phone will appeal mostly to people who already use Amazon services heavily. \"Any loyalist of iPhones or Google is going to have to judge whether there's enough value in what Amazon is offering with Fire to make the transition,\" he said. Samsung and Apple dominate worldwide smartphone sales with a combined 46 percent share, according to IDC. And in the U.S., Apple leads with more than 37 percent, with Samsung at nearly 29 percent. Amazon could succeed even if it doesn't steal market share from the top phone makers. Michael Scanlon, managing director with John Hancock Asset Management, said success will be measured by whether Amazon can increase loyalty among its Amazon Prime members and get them to boost purchases. Amazon is giving Fire owners a free year of membership, which normally costs $99, and existing subscribers an extra 12 months of membership. Prime offers free two-day shipping, encouraging impulse purchases. It also offers free access to some movies, TV shows, music and books and could encourage consumers to buy additional content, once they are used to the offerings. Meanwhile, Firefly could encourage more purchases. The feature lets you snap bar codes, phone numbers and more. It can even direct you to facts and data, such as a Wikipedia entry with information about a painting you snapped. It listens to songs, TV shows and movies and can pull up extra info like lyrics, actor bios and other information through its IMDb database.

{"text": "Amazon has introduced a new smartphone with audio and object recognition technology that seeks to make it easier for consumers to locate and purchase products and services from the nation's largest e-commerce company. The new Fire phone also adds such features as the ability to render images in 3D. The Fire phone doesn't differ much from other smartphones on the market and shares many characteristics found in other Amazon devices. Firefly identifies songs, objects for you to buy Amazon's new Firefly feature allows users to take a photo of an object, such as a toaster or a soup can, and get more information about it, including a way to purchase it through Amazon. Many of the new features have been available elsewhere as separate apps. Sony, for instance, has a tool for getting information over the internet by snapping a bar code or a landmark. Firefly goes further, though, by incorporating audio recognition. \"It goes back to the mission of Amazon, which is to sell you stuff,\" said Ramon Llamas of the research firm IDC. \"It reduces the number of steps it takes to buy things on the phone.\" The phone will have a screen measuring 4.7 inches diagonally. That's smaller than leading Android phones, but larger than Apple's iPhone. CEO Jeff Bezos calls the Fire's size ideal for one-handed use. The phone will be available July 25 in the U.S. exclusively through ATandT. People can start ordering it Wednesday. Amazon would not say when the phone would be available in Canada. Double the storage of leading high-end phones Prices are comparable to other leading high-end phones, but the Fire will have double the storage. It will cost $200 for a base model with 32 gigabytes and $300 for 64 gigabytes. Both require two-year service contracts. Without contracts, they will cost $650 and $750. The phone will come with 12 months of Prime membership, which is normally $99 a year. Existing Prime members will get their term extended. Competing won't be easy, though, particularly because Fire's prices aren't lower, Llamas said. With tablets, Amazon has been able to beat Apple and its iPads on price. Amazon makes up for that by selling more content. Amazon is also arriving late to a tightly contested marketplace. Samsung and Apple dominate worldwide smartphone sales with a combined 46 per cent share, according to IDC. And in the U.S., Apple leads with more than 37 per cent, with Samsung at nearly 29 per cent. As the phone was announced in Seattle, Amazon's stock rose $8.82, or 3 per cent, to $334.44 in afternoon trading. Firefly is the centerpiece of the new phone. Snap a photo of a book, and it'll help you buy it, either as an e-book or a physical copy. Listen to a song playing in the background, and it'll direct you to that tune on Amazon. It can even direct you to facts and data, by showing a Wikipedia entry with information about a painting you snapped. The feature will also let you snap bar codes, phone numbers and more. Another distinctive feature is 3D images. You can rotate the phone and get a different view depending on your angle of vision. CEO Jeff Bezos calls this \"dynamic perspective\" and said the phone is basically redrawing the image 60 times per second. To make that happen, the phone has four front-facing infrared cameras to tell where your head is, even if your fingers happen to cover two of them. That is on top of the regular 2 megapixel front camera for selfies, plus the 13 megapixel one on the rear for regular shots. The rear camera will have image stabilization to counteract shaking as people take shots, something available in other phones as well. Unlimited free photo storage on cloud Amazon is offering unlimited free storage of photos on its Cloud Drive service. The phone will also come with earbuds that have flat cords and magnets to clasp them together, so tangled cords will be history. And it will have an auto-scroll feature that lets you scroll down website articles or books by tilting the phone. Samsung's Galaxy phones have that, too. The decision to make ATandT the exclusive carrier is similar to the approach Apple took when it unveiled its first iPhone in 2007. ATandT had exclusive rights to the iPhone in the U.S. until 2011, when Verizon and eventually others got it, too. Amazon's first gadget was a Kindle e-reader, released in 2007. Although there are plenty of devices that do more, many people still prefer stand-alone e-book readers because they typically have better screens for reading in direct sunlight and don't have distractions such as Facebook and email. The company started making Kindle Fire tablets in 2011. The latest models, HDX, are notable for a Mayday help button that accesses live tech support 24 hours a day, seven days a week. With Mayday, which the Fire phone will also have, you see the customer assistance representatives in a video box, but they can only hear you and see what's on your screen. They can also help guide you by placing orange markers on your screen or taking control of your device completely. In April, Amazon released its Fire TV streaming devices. What sets it apart from rival gadgets is a voice search feature that lets you speak the title, actor, director or genre into your remote to get matching content on the TV.

{"text": "After months of rumor and speculation, Amazon has jumped into the smartphone market with the launch of its eagerly-anticipated Fire Phone. Most of the hype over the last few months has focused on the devices 3D capabilities, which Amazon duly delivered at the launch event in Seattle. Shrewdly, though, the online giant has also built a host of features into the Fire Phone that will pull users further into its vast retail empire. Powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor, the Fire Phone has a 4.7-inch screen and will be available exclusively on ATandT when it ships on July 25. Pricing starts at $199 for a 32GB version of the phone with a two-year contract. A 64 GB version will be priced at $299 with a two-year contract. The 32GB and 64GB versions will also be available with zero money down from $27.09 a month and $31.25 a month, respectively, on ATandT's Next 18 plan. The devices Firefly feature offers image, text and audio recognition, letting users scan QR and bar codes, Web and email addresses, and over 100 million other items, according to Amazon. This includes movies, TV shows, and song recognition in the style of the popular Shazam app. When Firefly recognizes a song, for example, it taps into the Amazon Music catalog. The retailer says that Firefly can identify 35 million songs. In addition to movies, TV shows and music, Firefly can recognize 70 million products, including household items, books, DVDs, CDs and video games. Fire Phone users can then access the relevant product details and order them from Amazon.com. From the company perspective, given that the their hardware devices make it so easy to purchase content, heres a brilliant new delivery mechanism that will give Amazon yet another dimension into its already virtually-360 degree view of its customers behaviors, wrote retail expert Robin Lewis, CEO of \"The Robin Report\" newsletter, in an email to FoxNews.com. Amazon is also offering a free 12-month membership to its Prime service for Fire Phone customers, further underlining the companys desire to bring new customers into its world. Existing Prime users will receive an additional 12 months added to their account. Additionally, the company is touting free unlimited cloud storage of photos taken with the phone and a mayday feature, which establishes a live video link with an Amazon expert to walk users through the phones features. Although initially synonymous with retail goods such as books and DVDs, Amazon has significantly expanded its reach in recent years. From electronic devices such as the Kindle, Amazon Fire TV to the web services and even art sales, the retailer is constantly eyeing new ways to strengthen its customer relationships. As expected, plenty of attention has been focused on the Fire Phones 3D capabilities. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos introduced these features during the launch event, which the company describes as dynamic perspective. This gives users the ability to scroll through Web pages by tilting the screen and see different views of products in the Amazon Shopping app. Dynamic perspective could have a big impact in video gaming. Amazon has applied the technology to the Lili game, with users tilting their heads to alter a characters perspective. While the world didnt think it needed another smart phone, the Fire Phones dynamic 3-dimensional perspective is a nifty feature that consumers will probably love, wrote Lewis. Amazon, however, faces stiff competition in the smartphone market, where it is up against Apples iPhone and a host of Samsung Android devices. Apple is also expected to launch its iPhone 6 later this year, which could increase the pressure on the Fire Phone.", "label": {"what": ["`Amazon has jumped into the smartphone market with the launch of its eagerly-anticipated Fire Phone", "initially synonymous with retail goods such as books and DVDs, Amazon has significantly expanded its reach in recent years", "Amazon has applied the technology to the Lili game"], "when": ["months of", "over the last few months", "on July 25", "two-year", "a month", "12-month", "initially", "in recent years", "during the launch event", "later this year"], "where": ["into the smartphone market", "at the launch event in Seattle", "into its vast retail empire", "on ATandT", "in the style of the popular Shazam app", "into the Amazon Music catalog", "from Amazon.com", "in an email to FoxNews.com", "in the Amazon Shopping app", "in the smartphone market", "on the Fire Phone"], "why": ["pull users further into its vast retail empire", "make it so easy to purchase content", "a brilliant new delivery mechanism", "desire to bring new customers into its world", "walk users through the phones features", "strengthen its customer relationships", "to alter a characters perspective", "the Fire Phones dynamic 3-dimensional perspective"], "who": ["Amazon", "the online giant", "users", "The retailer", "Fire Phone users", "expert Robin Lewis, CEO of 'The Robin Report' newsletter", "Fire Phone customers", "new customers", "Existing Prime users", "an Amazon expert", "the retailer", "Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos", "the company"], "product_name": ["Fire Phone", "a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor", "books and DVDs", "the Kindle", "Amazon Fire TV", "Apples iPhone", "a host of Samsung Android devices", "iPhone 6"], "countermeasures": ["Most of the hype over the last few months has focused on the devices 3D capabilities", "has also built a host of features into the Fire Phone", "The 32GB and 64GB versions will also be available with zero money", "given that the their hardware devices", "here is a brilliant new delivery mechanism", "offering a free 12-month membership to its Prime service for Fire Phone customers", "Existing Prime users will receive an additional 12 months added to their account", "the company is touting free unlimited cloud storage of photos taken with the phone", "a mayday feature", "Amazon has significantly expanded its reach", "the retailer is constantly eyeing new ways", "This gives users the ability to scroll through Web pages", "launch its iPhone 6"], "new_features": ["3D capabilities", "a 4.7-inch screen", "Firefly feature", "offers image, text and audio recognition", "identify 35 million songs", "give Amazon yet another dimension", "a mayday feature"], "how": ["eagerly-anticipated", "be available exclusively on ATandT", "letting users scan QR and bar codes, Web and email addresses", "over 100 million other items", "it taps into the Amazon Music catalog", "access the relevant product details and order them from Amazon.com", "already virtually-360 degree view of its customers behaviors", "establishes a live video link with an Amazon expert", "by tilting the screen and see different views of products in the Amazon Shopping app", "with users tilting their heads"], "effects": ["Firefly can recognize 70 million products, including household items, books, DVDs, CDs and video games", "plenty of attention has been focused on the Fire Phones 3D capabilities", "Dynamic perspective could have a big impact in video gaming", "faces stiff competition in the smartphone market", "increase the pressure on the Fire Phone"]}}
{"text": "Amazon entered the smartphone war on Wednesday with the Fire Phone, a feature-packed device built for shopping and aimed at turning up the heat on rivals Apple and Google. The announcement at a press conference in Seattle came after a lengthy PR tease that involved sending a childrens storybook to reporters and a video of people fawning over an unseen device. \"We at Amazon like to do things a little different, said Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. The Fire Phone will pitch Amazon into a fight dominated by Apple and Samsung, which dominate the smartphone market. But the company is clearly taking aim at Google, too, as the search giant tries to build its own media and music business through Google Play. Amazon has struck deals with Netflix, HBO Go and Hulu Plus to stream movies and TV on the device, and Bezos made clear he was courting the millions of people who use its Amazon Prime service to get music and films to encourage them to swap devices. The new device comes with a 4.7in screen, a 13 megapixel rear camera with an f2.0 lens that Bezos said was better able to take photos in low lighting than its competitors from Apple and Samsung. The phone will come with free, unlimited photo storage via Amazon Cloud Drive. It will also come with what Bezos promised would be tangle-free headphones. Bezos also revealed the device will use its four cameras to show images in dynamic perspective  technology that will render maps, pictures of clothing and other images with a 3D perspective. The cameras will also allow the phone to recognise head gestures from users to change the display. The phone is equipped with a Quad-core 2.2GHz processor, Adreno 330 graphics and 2GB of RAM. Amazon is offering the Fire for $199 with a two-year contract from ATandT, in line with what the carrier charges for the iPhone 5S. UK pricing was not immediately available. The contract will also include 12 months of Amazon Prime, its $99 paid membership service which offers free two-day shipping and access to music, movies and TV shows from the retailers streaming video service. Bezos announced that the phone would run a program called Firefly that recognise items including songs, books, groceries and then enable you to buy them from Amazon. The service will also recognise restaurant signs, wine labels, paintings, linking users to sites giving more information about them. Firefly recognizes a hundred million different items in real-world situations,\" Bezos said. Bezos spent the early part of the presentation talking about Amazon Prime, its paid-membership service which offers free two-day shipping and access to music, movies and TV shows from the retailers streaming video service. The Amazon boss is clearly hoping he can tempt those Prime customers to switch to Fire in what has become a ferociously competitive and difficult market. Facebook, Google and Microsoft have all faced major setbacks with smartphones. Facebook released a phone with HTC in April 2013, but the device was a flop. Googles Android operating system has been a huge success but the search giant's attempts to launch its own phones have been disastrous. Microsofts Windows phone operating system accounts for less than 3% of the world smartphone market. There will be 1.76bn smartphone users worldwide in 2014, according to eMarketer, but just two manufacturers, Apple and Samsung, have managed to make profits. \"An Amazon smartphone would be less about profiting from device sales per se, and more a way to pocket a larger share of multiple revenue streams, such as mobile retail sales, mobile content and advertising,\" said Cathy Boyle, senior analyst, mobile, at eMarketer. The smartphone market will be far more difficult for Amazon to dominate than the tablet market or even the ebook sector, where the original Kindle holds sway. The US and UK markets are rapidly approaching saturation point: about 70% of all mobile phone owners in both countries have a smartphone. Bezos's buyers are likely to be Amazon customers already; it has 244m active customer accounts worldwide, but as half its revenues come from north America, many of those are probably in the US. His prime targets will be people who are also already on ATandT (in the US) or Vodafone (in the UK), and already smartphone owners. However, Amazon will find it hard to challenge Apple or Samsung, which have the highest customer loyalty among phone brands, and dominate the US and UK.

{"text": "Amazon's decision to launch a smartphone on Wednesday in Seattle may look to some like a bid for world domination. Many details have leaked before its launch: it will have a 4.7in screen, and be available only on ATandT in the US and perhaps Vodafone in the UK; for its \"wow\" factor it will have front-facing cameras together with a screen that can give the impression of showing a moving 3D-object. And it joins the Kindle Fire tablet (first launched in September 2011, and now on its third generation) and recently launched Fire TV set-top box. But Jeff Bezos, Amazon's determined founder and chief executive, will know that the smartphone market will be far more difficult to dominate - or even to break into - than the tablet or set-top box market, and much harder than the ebook market where the original Kindle holds sway. The US smartphone market is rapidly approaching saturation: 170m, or nearly 70% of all mobile phone owners there, have one, and the remaining 48m (or 20%) who are likely to buy one, because 10% will probably stick to simple \"featurephones\", are increasingly price-sensitive. The story is the same in the UK: 70% have smartphones, and that figure will probably top out at 92% in mid-2016. Bezos's most likely buyers are already Amazon customers; it has 244m active customer accounts worldwide, but as half its revenues come from north America, many of those are probably in the US. His prime targets will be people who are also already on ATandT (in the US) or Vodafone (in the UK), and already smartphone owners. However, Amazon will find it hard to challenge Apple or Samsung, which have the highest customer loyalty among phone brands, and dominate the US and UK. Instead, its best chance of finding converts initially will be owners of weakening Android brands such as HTC, LG or Motorola, which are losing users in the US. You might wonder whether the 3D effect - and rumoured \"gesture\" control - wouldn't be enough to tempt people to give up their iPhone or Galaxy S. Richard Windsor of the RadioFreeMobile consultancy, who has seen many 3D attempts, suggests not. LG had a 3D display phone; it sunk without trace in 2012 amid reviews noting a terrible battery life. \"This kind of active tracking of the user and adjusting the picture will be processor intensive. This means that battery life will be worse than competing devices,\" he says. \"The leader in developing this technology was Toshiba but it has recently given up developing the technology after failing to get it to work to a level that was considered acceptable  Amazon is right to differentiate its device, but it needs to do so in its [app] ecosystem not in hardware gimmicks.\" The key question therefore is: how will Bezos measure the success of the phone? Amazon's aim with its hardware has always been to lock in its most loyal and big-spending customers by offering the device at a low price, and making profit on the content that people buy through it - from Amazon, of course. \"An Amazon smartphone would be less about profiting from device sales per se and more a way to pocket a larger share of multiple revenue streams, such as mobile retail sales, mobile content and advertising,\" says Cathy Boyle, senior analyst, mobile, at eMarketer. Thus the Kindle e-reader was cheap, and appeals to people who buy a lot of books (because in the US, anyone who buys more than one book a year is buying more than the average). The Kindle Fire tablet has a high specification for its price, because Amazon wants to attract people who will buy videos, music and of course books to consume on it. Thus sheer device sales aren't Amazon's concern. According to the research company IDC, Amazon has sold about 26m Kindle Fires since its launch; sales spike each Christmas quarter, and trail off afterwards. That compares to 172m worldwide from Apple, and 71m from Samsung. But like Apple, Amazon tailors its app store and software so that they're a funnel for buying from it. Bezos is also being canny by using a version of Google's Android which omits Google services (and so avoids losing control to one of his business rivals). Android is the dominant software for mobiles in the US, being used by 52.5% of owners according to ComScore, another research company; Apple's iPhone has 41.4%. That should mean that using Amazon's phone isn't a dramatic departure in the user experience for many. Yet Bezos's hand has almost been forced, suggests Jan Dawson of Utah-based Jackdaw Research, as the era of \"e-commerce\" on desktop computers gives way to \"m-commerce\", where people buy via their smartphones and tablets. People in the US and UK already spend more time on their mobiles than PCs; this move recognises that. \"Imagine whats possible when Amazon controls the whole smartphone experience: a dedicated app on the homescreen (perhaps even triggered by a hardware button) which launches an app for quickly adding things to your Amazon wish list or cart, via barcode or image capture and OCR,\" suggest Dawson. \"The friction involved in translating a real-world discovery of an appealing product into an Amazon purchase would be greatly reduced.\" Yet given how early Bezos saw the potential of online commerce, the puzzle is why he has taken so long to exploit m-commerce. He may have decided that the investment wouldn't pay off until smartphones were commonplace - unlike the bet he took in setting up Amazon. According to eMarketer, a research company, the logic is simple. In the US, retail sales via smartphones will rise 25.4% to $18.49bn this year, representing 32% of all mobile retail sales (which include tablets). In the UK, smartphone retail sales will reach 4.65bn this year - approximately one-third of overall mobile retail sales. A smartphone also offers the chance to serve mobile advertising - where eMarketer says Amazon has just 0.3% of the $33bn global mobile advertising market. So Bezos has his work cut out. Launching a phone is easy. Making it a success is not - as Facebook and HTC learnt with their HTC First phone, released in April 2013 on ATandT and unceremoniously dumped a month later. Amazon is a big noise on the desktop. It still has everything to prove in mobile.", "label": {"what": ["Amazon's decision to launch a smartphone", "nearly 70% of all mobile phone owners there, have one, and the remaining 48m (or 20%) who are likely to buy one, because 10% will probably stick to simple featurephones, are increasingly price-sensitive", "The story is the same in the UK: 70% have smartphones, and that figure will probably top out at 92% in mid-2016"], "when": ["on Wednesday", "in September 2011", "in mid-2016", "in 2012Christmas quarter", "this year", "in April 2013", "a month later"], "where": ["in Seattle", "on ATandT", "in the US", "in the UK", "worldwide", "from north America", "from Amazon", "on the homescreen", "on the desktop", "in mobile"], "why": ["look to some like a bid for world domination", "LG had a 3D display phone; it sunk without trace in 2012 amid reviews noting a terrible battery life", "This kind of active tracking of the user and adjusting the picture will be processor intensive.

{"text": "Amazon on Wednesday announced a device that tries to fulfill the retailers dream of being integrated into consumers lives at every possible waking moment  whether they are deciding where to eat, realizing they need more toilet paper or intrigued by a snatch of overheard music. The device is a cellphone, but making calls on it got almost no attention at all at the event in Seattle where it was unveiled. The Fire phone, the product of four years of research and development, offers Amazon fans the chance to live in an Amazon-themed world, where just about every element can be identified, listed, ranked, shared and, of course, ordered. It offered a view of a mobile future that will be alluring to some but might repel others. If the device works as described, and Amazon entices even a small portion of its 250 million active customers to buy one, the Fire could accelerate Amazons already intense competition with other retailers and tech companies, not to mention heightening some of its current battles with suppliers. As if to underline the no-gloves nature of the battle, a promotional video in the first few moments of the presentation took a direct slap at Apple. Both Apple and Samsung were criticized as having inferior cameras in their devices, and there seemed to be other jabs at technology like Google Glass. The Fires product recognition feature, Firefly, is potentially a real threat to bricks and mortar retailers, said Rebecca Lieb, an analyst with the Altimeter Group. Scan a product or listen to music, and youre delivered straight to the page on Amazon on which you can purchase it. Impulse shopping just went to a new level. Amazons phone  consumers can order it now; it ships starting July 25  is arriving as the leading technology companies are increasingly trying to develop an array of services and products to keep people from wandering, the digital equivalent of Disney not wanting you to leave Disneyland for lunch. Microsoft brought out a tablet; Facebook tried a phone; Google is experimenting with a shopping and delivery service. Against such a frenzy of competition and innovation, an Amazon phone was inevitable. The companys leaders asked themselves only one question, Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazons founder and chief executive, told the crowd at the event: Can we build a better phone for our most engaged customers? Mr. Bezos promoted Firefly heavily, as well as something Amazon calls Dynamic Perspective. Cameras on the phone allow the user to gain another view of a video game or see layered information on a map, like a Yelp review. Whether Dynamic Perspective is a gimmick or something more will depend on how aggressively developers invent new apps for it. This is the next big battleground in the ecosystem war, said Ben Schachter, an analyst with Macquarie. Amazon is not going to turn the tide decisively in its favor with this, but just needs to establish a beachhead. The announcement took place in a warehouselike space filled with 300 members of the news media, app developers and handpicked Amazon fans. The presentation began with videos from people begging to attend; 60,000 people applied to do so. Mr. Bezos began by citing laudatory reviews of the companys existing hardware, including its tablets. The most important thing weve done over 20 years is earn trust with customers, he said. Amazons leap into the smartphone business comes as sales of the devices are beginning to mature, at least in the United States and Europe. Their use for shopping, however, is just starting to explode. In the United States, purchases made with phones will jump more than 25 percent this year to over $18 billion, according to eMarketer. At the moment, most mobile shopping is done with tablets. Mr. Bezos, for all his zeal, was relatively circumspect about the phones ultimate implications. Ralph de la Vega, chief executive of ATandT Mobility, Amazons carrier partner, was more direct during a brief appearance on stage. I am going to buy a whole lot more things with this technology than I ever have before, Mr. de la Vega said. One interesting question will be whether the phone will allow apps that might take customers to retailers whose prices undercut Amazon. Will residents of Planet Amazon, in other words, be permitted to visit other shopping worlds? Our idea is to give the lowest price to the customer, Dave Limp, an Amazon executive, said in an interview. If we dont have it, shame on us. As for whether customers will go into physical stores, check a price with Firefly, and order the item right then  inflaming Amazons already bitter relations with Main Street  Mr. Limp noted that people could do the reverse: Look up something on Amazon and then buy it in a store. Both ways are very valuable for customers, he said. The lengthy development process for the Amazon phone was partly a result of the difficulty of the task. Phones are a graveyard of tech dreams. Just ask Google, which was hailed as a genius for buying the handset maker Motorola, and then hailed again for cutting its losses and promptly selling the faded icon. Only Apple and Samsung have found making phones consistently profitable. But Amazon, as always, is operating with a different playbook. When Amazon introduced the Kindle Fire in 2011, there was a lot of chatter about its being a challenge to Apples iPad. It was not. In the first quarter of this year, Apple had about a third of the tablet market, according to the research firm IDC. Amazon had less than 2 percent. Still, that is a million more consumers taking up residence in the Amazon ecosystem. Just about anyone who has a Kindle Fire is a candidate for membership in Amazons fast-shipping club, Amazon Prime, and just about any Prime member might be enticed to buy a Kindle. Amazon Prime has an estimated 20 million subscribers, who pay $99 a year. The Fire Phone, which will be available late next month, costs $199 with a two-year contract with ATandT. But Amazon, as expected, is sweetening the deal with a year of free membership in the Prime club. If they are able to capture 10 percent of those Prime subscribers in the near term, then that would likely constitute a success, said Eugene Signorini, vice president of mobile insights at Mobiquity. That would force Google and Apple, and possibly Facebook and Microsoft as well, to introduce innovations and new features in their own products. That would benefit consumers in the short term, Mr. Schachter said. And in the long term, if Amazon or one of the other companies becomes dominant to the exclusion of all others? That might be more problematic, Mr. Schachter said.", "label": {"what": ["Amazon on Wednesday announced a device that tries to fulfill the retailers dream of being integrated into consumers lives at every possible waking moment whether they are deciding where to eat, realizing they need more toilet paper or intrigued by a snatch of overheard music", "intense competition with other retailers and tech companies, not to mention heightening some of its current battles with suppliers", "Both Apple and Samsung were criticized as having inferior cameras in their devices, and there seemed to be other jabs at technology like Google Glass"], "when": ["on Wednesday", "at every possible waking moment", "four years", "in the first few moments of the presentation", "now", "July 25", "At the moment", "in 2011", "over 20 years", "In the first quarter of this year", "a year", "late next month", "two-year", "in the short term", "in the long term"], "where": ["at the event", "in Seattle", "in an Amazon-themed world", "in their devices", "on a map", "in the ecosystem war", "in a warehouselike space", "in the United States and Europe", "on stage", "in an interview", "into physical stores", "in Amazons fast-shipping club", "in their own products"], "why": ["to underline the no-gloves nature of the battle", "Microsoft brought out a tablet; Facebook tried a phone; Google is experimenting with a shopping and delivery service", "Amazons leap into the smartphone business comes as sales of the devices are beginning to mature, at least in the United States and Europe", "At the moment, most mobile shopping is done with tablets"], "who": ["250 million active customers", "tech companies", "suppliers", "Both Apple and Samsung", "Rebecca Lieb, an analyst with the Altimeter Group", "The companys leaders", "Jeffrey P.

{"text": "Amazon wants you to buy its first smartphone, the Fire, which it unveiled Wednesday. But it also wants you to use that phone to buy more stuff ... from Amazon. And one of the device's most distinctive features is designed to make it as easy as possible do just that. It's called Firefly, and it contains image-, text- and audio-recognition technology to help you scan and identify books, songs, movies and other items. Amazon wants you to use Firefly so much that the feature has its own dedicated button on the side of the phone for one-stop shopping. \"The Firefly button lets you identify printed Web and email addresses, phone numbers, QR and bar codes, artwork, and over 100 million items, including songs, movies, TV shows, and products -- and take action in seconds,\" Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in announcing the phone, which will run Amazon's Fire operating system. For example, you could use the phone's cameras and sensors to identify an exotic fruit or vegetable, figure out who sings a song on the radio or help send an e-mail to a new contact after scanning their business card. But forget all that. Well, except for maybe the song. Once you've identified the tune, Amazon wants you to download it. From Amazon. Bezos demonstrated the feature onstage Wednesday by using the phone to instantly identify items arrayed on a table, including a book, a CD and a jar of Nutella. As with products like its Kindle e-readers, Kindle Fire tablets and Amazon Fire TV, the Fire Phone is designed to pull you into Amazon's growing universe of products and services and then keep you there. So with Firefly, the Amazon Music Store will pop up as the default source to buy that song. And that's also where those QR and bar codes come in. Firefly will make it even easier to pursue a habit that has proliferated in the smartphone age and driven brick-and-mortar stores crazy. A user will presumably be able to walk into a store, pick out a product they like, zap it with Firefly and, within a second or two, find out whether it's available on Amazon for less money. (And then maybe even order it right there from their phone.) According to Amazon, the Firefly feature will recognize 70 million products, 35 million songs, 245,000 movies and TV episodes, and 160 live TV channels That's a lot of chances to spend money. The Fire also boasts a 3-D screen. It ships July 25, although you can pre-order it now. The phone is available only on ATandT's network. If there's one difference between the Firefly-loaded Fire Phone and other Amazon hardware, it's the price. At $199 for a 32GB model and $299 for the 64GB -- with an ATandT contract -- its cost is comparable with that of other high-end smartphones. By comparison, the Kindle Fire tablet debuted in 2011 at $199, a full $300 less than the cheapest iPad 2 at the time. The first Kindle e-reader debuted about $400 but quickly dropped in price. There are Kindles that can now be purchased for about $70. Under Bezos, the company's strategy has been to sell hardware for less than its competitors, sometimes even at a loss, to get customers using other Amazon products. As such, customers who buy the Fire soon will get a free year's subscription (normally $99) to Amazon Prime, which offers two-day shipping, free streaming on Prime Instant Video and access to the Kindle book-lending library. Whether the Fire Phone will be an instant hit remains to be seen. Shoppers may be hesitant to buy a phone online if they can't test it out in stores. But if Amazon can carve out a decent piece of the smartphone market, which moved more than 1 billion phones last year, Firefly may help make sure those Amazon purchases just keep on coming.", "label": {"what": ["Amazon wants you to buy its first smartphone", "Kindle Fire tablets and Amazon Fire TV, the Fire Phone is designed to pull you into Amazon's growing universe of products and services and then keep you there", "if Amazon can carve out a decent piece of the smartphone market, which moved more than 1 billion phones last year, Firefly may help make sure those Amazon purchases just keep on coming"], "when": ["Wednesday", "in the smartphone age", "within a second or two", "July 25", "in 2011", "a free year", "two-day", "last year"], "where": ["from Amazon", "on the side of the phone", "on the radio", "to a new contact", "on a table", "into a store", "from their phone", "on ATandT's network", "on Prime Instant Video", "the smartphone market"], "why": ["Amazon wants you to use Firefly so much that the feature has its own dedicated button on the side of the phone for one-stop shopping", "Under Bezos, the company's strategy has been to sell hardware for less than its competitors, sometimes even at a loss, to get customers using other Amazon products", "Shoppers may be hesitant to buy a phone online if they can't test it out in stores"], "who": ["Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos", "A user", "its competitors", "customers", "Shoppers"], "how": ["The Firefly button lets you identify printed Web and email addresses, phone numbers, QR and bar codes, artwork, and over 100 million items, including songs, movies, TV shows, and products -- and take action in seconds", "use the phone's cameras and sensors to identify an exotic fruit or vegetable, figure out who sings a song on the radio or help send an e-mail to a new contact after scanning their business card"], "product_name": ["Firefly", "Firefly Fire Phone", "Kindle e-reader"], "countermeasures": ["By comparison, the Kindle Fire tablet debuted in 2011 at $199, a full $300 less than the cheapest iPad 2 at the time", "The first Kindle e-reader debuted about $400 but quickly dropped in price.

Will residents of Planet Amazon, in other words, be permitted to visit other shopping worlds? \"Our idea is to give the lowest price to the customer,\" Dave Limp, an Amazon executive, said in an interview. \"If we don't have it, shame on us.\" As for whether customers will go into physical stores, check a price with Firefly, and order the item right then - inflaming Amazon's already bitter relations with Main Street - Limp noted that people could do the reverse: Look up something on Amazon and then buy it in a store. \"Both ways are very valuable for customers,\" he said. The lengthy phone development process for Amazon was partly because of the difficulty of the task. Phones are a graveyard of tech dreams. Just ask Google, which was hailed as a genius for buying the handset maker Motorola, and then hailed again for cutting its losses and promptly selling the faded icon. Only Apple and Samsung have found it consistently profitable to make phones. But Amazon, as always, is operating with a different playbook. When Amazon introduced the Kindle Fire in 2011, there was a lot of chatter about its being a challenge to Apple's iPad. It was not. In the first quarter of this year, Apple had about a third of the tablet market, according to the research firm IDC. Amazon had less than 2 percent. Still, that's a million more consumers taking up residence in the Amazon ecosystem. Just about anyone who has a Kindle Fire is a good candidate for membership in Amazon's fast shipping club, Amazon Prime, and just about any Prime member might be enticed to buy a Kindle. Amazon Prime has an estimated 20 million subscribers, who pay $99 a year. The Fire Phone, which will be available late next month, costs $199 for a two-year contract with ATandT. But Amazon, as expected, is sweetening the deal with a year of free membership in the Prime club. \"If they are able to capture 10 percent of those Prime subscribers in the near term, then that would likely constitute a success,\" said Eugene Signorini, vice president of mobile insights at Mobiquity. That would force Google and Apple, and possibly Facebook and Microsoft as well, to introduce new innovations and features in their own products. That would benefit consumers in the short term, Schachter said. And in the long term, if Amazon or one of the other companies becomes dominant to the exclusion of all others? \"That might be more problematic,\" Schachter said.", "label": {"what": ["Amazon on Wednesday announced a device", "Both Apple and Samsung were criticized", "The Fire Phone, which will be available late next month"], "when": ["on Wednesday", "now", "July 25", "late next month"], "where": ["in Seattle", "at the event", "in a warehouselike space", "in an interview", "in the Amazon ecosystem", "in the Prime club", "at Mobiquity"], "why": ["tries to fulfill the retailer's dream of being integrated into consumers' lives at every possible waking moment", "As if to underline the no-gloves nature of the battle", "having inferior cameras in their devices", "the leading tech companies are increasingly trying to develop an array of services and products to keep consumers from wandering", "was partly because of the difficulty of the task"], "who": ["Amazon", "Apple", "Samsung", "Rebecca Lieb, an analyst with the Altimeter Group", "The company's leaders", "Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and chief executive", "the crowd", "Ben Schachter, an analyst with Macquarie", "Ralph de la Vega, chief executive of ATandT Mobility, Amazon's carrier partner", "Dave Limp, an Amazon executive", "the research firm IDC", "Eugene Signorini, vice president of mobile insights"], "how": ["whether they are deciding where to eat, realizing they need more toilet paper or intrigued by a snatch of overheard music", "The device is a cellphone, but making calls on it got almost no attention at all", "the product of four years of research and development, offers Amazon fans the chance to live in an Amazon-themed world", "It offered a view of a mobile future that will be alluring to some but might repel others", "a promotional video in the first few moments of the presentation took a direct slap at Apple", "there seemed to be other jabs at technology like Google Glass", "Whether Dynamic Perspective is a gimmick or something more will depend on how aggressively developers invent new apps for it", "The announcement took place in a warehouselike space filled with 300 members of the news media, app developers and hand-picked Amazon fans", "The presentation began with videos from people begging to attend", "began by citing laudatory reviews of the company's existing hardware, including its tablets", "In the first quarter of this year, Apple had about a third of the tablet market, according to the research firm IDC.

{"text": "Amazon has introduced a new smartphone that will be closely tied to the products and services it sells, while adding such touches as the ability to render images in 3D. It was announced Wednesday and will start shipping next month. Here are some details on the new Fire phone: 1. Audio and object recognition With a new Firefly feature, snap a photo of a book, and it'll show you where to buy it. Listen to a song playing in the background, and it'll direct you to that tune on Amazon. It can even direct you to knowledge, such as pulling up a Wikipedia entry on a painting you snapped. The feature will also let you snap bar codes, email addresses, phone numbers and more. This concept isn't entirely new. Sony, for instance, has a tool for getting information over the Internet by snapping a bar code or a landmark. Firefly goes further, though, by incorporating audio recognition. 2. 3D images You can rotate the phone and get a different view depending on your angle of vision. CEO Jeff Bezos calls this \"dynamic perspective\" and said the phone is basically redrawing the image 60 times per second. To make that happen, the phone has four front-facing infrared cameras to tell where your head is, even if your fingers happen to cover two of them. You can use this feature, for instance, to get front and back views of a dress you are thinking of buying. You can take a character's viewpoint in games by moving your head to look around. 3. Taking photos Beyond the four infrared cameras, there's a regular, 2-megapixel camera on the front for selfies and a 13-megapixel camera on the back. That's standard for phones these days. The rear camera has image stabilization to counteract shaking as people take shots, something available in other phones as well. Amazon is offering unlimited free storage of photos taken with the Fire on its Cloud Drive service. 4. Other details At 4.7-inches, as measured diagonally, the screen is smaller than leading Android phone, but larger than Apple's iPhone. Bezos calls the Fire's screen ideal for one-handed use. The phone will come with earbuds that have flat cords and magnets to clasp them together, so tangled cords will be history. There's an auto-scroll feature that lets you scroll down website articles or books by tilting the phone. Samsung's Galaxy phones have that, too. 5. Availability ATandT will be the exclusive carrier. The phone will be available July 25. People can start ordering them Wednesday at $200 for a base model with 32 gigabytes and $300 for 64 gigabytes. Both require two-year service contracts. The phone comes with 12 months of Prime membership, which is normally $99 a year. Existing Prime members will get their term extended. 6. Not a first Facebook once tried to release a phone tied to its services. The HTC First, released in April 2013, came with Facebook's Home software, which takes over the phone's front screen to present status updates, messages and other content. Both the phone and the software flopped. Google also has its own phones under the Nexus brand, mostly to showcase its Android operating system. Google makes Android available for free for any phone manufacturer to use and modify.

The still-unnamed watch, which Apple followers have dubbed the iWatch, will be the company's first foray into a niche product category that many remain skeptical about, especially as to whether it can drive profits as growth slows in tech gadgets. The production will be a boost to Quanta, whose work for Apple so far has focused on laptops and iPods, product lines that are in decline. Quanta's role, though, is likely to raise questions about what involvement Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, one of Apple's biggest suppliers, will play in production.

The device will only be compatible with gadgets running Apple's iOS, like its flagship iPhone, one of the sources said. Most mainstream smartwatches collect data about the user's heart rate and other health-related metrics, in addition to facilitating tasks like checking e-mail and making phone calls.

Game-changer? Apple's smartwatch will follow similar devices by Samsung, Sony Corp, Motorola and LG Electronics Inc - gadgets that tech watchers say have not been appealing or user-friendly enough to ignite a wave of mass adoption. But the market is growing fast, with data firm IDC saying that worldwide shipments of wearable computing devices, including smartwatches, will triple this year over 2013. Apple has already dropped hints of its plans in this arena, hiring the former chief executive of French fashion house Yves Saint Laurent, a unit of Kering SA, and proclaiming that it will introduce \"new product categories\" this year. Many are hoping that Apple's entry into the field of so-called smart wearables will transform the industry like the company's iPhone did in 2007. Some forecast that smartphone sales, the current cash cow of the consumer tech world, will lose momentum as the market reaches saturation. IDC predicts that worldwide smartphone sales will increase 23 percent this year, slower than the 39 percent last year, and that annual growth will average only 12 percent from 2013 to 2018.", "label": {"what": ["Taiwan's Quanta Computer Inc will start mass production of Apple Inc's first smartwatch", "Mass production will start in July and the commercial launch will come as early as October"], "when": ["in July", "until now", "as early as October", "this year", "in 2007"], "where": ["at Quanta", "in this arena"], "why": ["the U.S. tech giant tries to prove it can still innovate against rival Samsung Electronics Co Ltd", "to whether it can drive profits as growth slows in tech gadgets", "work for Apple so far has focused on laptops and iPods, product lines that are in decline", "Apple's production plans are private"], "who": ["Taiwan's Quanta Computer Inc", "Apple Inc", "a source familiar with the matter", "Hon Hai Precision Industry Co", "another person familiar with the matter", "one of the sources", "Most mainstream smartwatches", "Display Co Ltd", "Singapore-based imaging and sensor maker Heptagon", "two other sources", "Samsung", "Sony Corp", "Motorola", "LG Electronics Inc"], "how": ["will be the company's first foray into a niche product category that many remain skeptical about", "is likely to raise questions about what involvement Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, one of Apple's biggest suppliers, will play in production", "While the watch has been widely expected, the start date of its mass production and the extent of Quanta's involvement were not known until now", "The sources requested anonymity", "these types of initial estimates can be subject to change", "The watch is in trial production at Quanta, which will be the main manufacturer, accounting for at least 70 percent of final assembly", "collect data about the user's heart rate and other health-related metrics", "facilitating tasks like checking e-mail and making phone calls", "Display Co Ltd is the exclusive supplier of the screen for the gadget's initial batch of production", "Singapore-based imaging and sensor maker Heptagon is on the supplier list for the feature", "Apple's smartwatch will follow similar devices by Samsung, Sony Corp, Motorola and LG Electronics Inc", "have not been appealing or user-friendly enough to ignite a wave of mass adoption", "Many are hoping that Apple's entry into the field of so-called smart wearables will transform the industry like the company's iPhone"], "product_name": ["still-unnamed watch, which Apple followers have dubbed the iWatch"], "countermeasures": ["Apple expects to ship 50 million units within the first year of the product's release", "Apple declined to comment", "Quanta, LG Display and Heptagon also declined to comment", "Apple has already dropped hints of its plans", "hiring the former chief executive of French fashion house Yves Saint Laurent, a unit of Kering SA", "proclaiming that it will introduce 'new product categories' this year"], "new_features": ["a smartwatch with a display that likely measures 2.5 inches diagonally and is slightly rectangular", "the watch face will protrude slightly from the band, creating an arched shape, and will feature a touch interface and wireless charging capabilities", "tasks like messaging and voice chat will require connection to a smartphone", "The device will only be compatible with gadgets running Apple's iOS, like its flagship iPhone", "contains a sensor that monitors the user's pulse"], "effects": ["The production will be a boost to Quanta", "will be able to perform some functions independently"]}}
{"text": "Rumored for years, the long-awaited smartwatch from Apple may finally become reality in a few months. The Wall Street Journal and Reuters are both reporting that the iWatch, if that is in fact it's name, will be released this fall, likely in October The Journal says the watch will come in multiple sizes and have 10 sensors for tasks like health and fitness tracking. Reuters says the watch will have a 2.5-inch screen and be \"slightly rectangular.\" Both outlets cited unnamed sources familiar with the matter. There's no reason to doubt the reports, really. Apple's top brass have all gone on the record suggesting a new product from Apple will be released by the end of this year. So, with the countdown likely begun, we take a look at five features we'd like to see on Apple's smartwatch. Really be 'smart' The dirty little secret of smartwatches, at least so far? They aren't really smart in the same way that a smartphone is. So far, the offerings from Samsung, Sony, LG and the like have operated as extensions of a smartphone, linking up via Bluetooth or wireless to, for the most part, serve you notifications that you could have seen by pulling your phone out of your pocket. Apple may do something along those lines as well and could still make a successful product. But with their close ties with app developers, we'd love to see Apple make the first smartwatch that lets you leave your phone behind. Wireless charging If you live in a household where at least a couple of people are competing for socket space to keep their smartphones, tablets, e-readers and the like charged up, things are probably already a tangled mess. Does anybody want one more device to fit in there? Whether it's a wireless charging pad or some new tech whipped up by Apple especially for its smartwatch, we'd love to be able to just set the watch down on the nightstand and have it powered up and ready to go the next morning. And speaking of: Battery life Nobody wants a watch that they have to charge up as often as they do their phone. At least for now, these things are nice extras, not essential communication tools, and if they become more trouble than they're worth, the love affair won't last long for even the most dedicated fanboys and fangirls. The smartwatches already on the market average somewhere around two or three days on a charge. The ones that do more, like Samsung's Galaxy Gear, are on the low end of that and those that do less tend to be higher. Apple is surely planning on releasing a feature-rich device. If it can somehow do that while figuring out how to jam a powerful battery into a tiny watch, it will be a nice selling point. Connectivity Apple's smartwatch is no doubt going to link up with your iPhone, and probably an iPad. But like a lot of other major tech companies, Apple wants to edge its way into a lot of other areas of your life, and it sure would be cool to be able to sync those other products with your watch. Play music on your iPod or iPhone with a tap of the watch. Change channels or pause movies on Apple TV. Beam photos or videos onto your television set via Airplay. All those abilities would be nice. And Apple is believed to be looking into the growing \"Internet of things,\" or connected objects such as cars and refrigerators. This might be a while (and a couple of smartwatch generations) away. But if you could perform home automation tasks like opening your garage, turning off your lights or locking your doors with a watch, we'd be impressed. Of course, it would be cool if the presumed iWatch would link up with non-Apple devices, like those running Google's Android system or Microsoft's Windows. But we're not holding our breath on that. Affordable price This is Apple. So, there's no reason to think it will depart from a model that's always worked for them. Unfortunately for budget-conscious consumers, that approach is to roll out finely crafted products at premium prices even while devices with similar features can be had without the Apple logo for less. But we hope this one is different. Nobody needs a digital watch and, as mentioned above, there's a decent chance that it won't even work unless you already own another, presumably pricey, Apple device. We'd like to see it priced as an affordable accessory for your iPhone in an effort to pull in customers who want, not need, one. Of course, nobody needed an iPad either. More than 200 million purchases later, it feels like Apple knew what it was doing.", "label": {"what": ["the long-awaited smartwatch from Apple may finally become reality", "The Wall Street Journal and Reuters are both reporting that the iWatch, if that is in fact it's name, will be released this fall", "have all gone on the record suggesting a new product from Apple will be released", "Apple is surely planning on releasing a feature-rich device", "Apple is believed to be looking into the growing 'Internet of things,' or connected objects such as cars and refrigerators"], "when": ["in a few months", "this fall", "in October", "by the end of this year", "so far", "now", "later"], "where": ["from Apple", "on Apple's smartwatch", "on Apple TV"], "why": ["their close ties with app developers", "these things are nice extras, not essential communication tools", "to roll out finely crafted products at premium prices", "you already own another, presumably pricey"], "who": ["The Wall Street Journal", "Reuters", "Both outlets", "Apple's top brass", "Samsung, Sony, LG and the like", "Apple"], "how": ["Rumored for years", "cited unnamed sources familiar with the matter", "with the countdown likely begun", "They aren't really smart in the same way that a smartphone is", "the offerings from Samsung, Sony, LG and the like have operated as extensions of a smartphone, linking up via Bluetooth or wireless to, for the most part, serve you notifications that you could have seen by pulling your phone out of your pocket", "like a lot of other major tech companies", "wants to edge its way into a lot of other areas of your life", "via Airplay", "it would be cool if the presumed iWatch would link up with non-Apple devices"], "product_name": ["iWatch"], "countermeasures": ["Apple may do something along those lines as well and could still make a successful product"], "new_features": ["the watch will come in multiple sizes and have 10 sensors for tasks like health and fitness tracking", "Wireless charging", "Connectivity", "Play music on your iPod or iPhone with a tap of the watch", "Change channels or pause movies", "Beam photos or videos onto your television set"], "effects": ["have a 2.5-inch screen and be 'slightly rectangular'", "just set the watch down on the nightstand and have it powered up and ready to go the next morning", "going to link up with your iPhone, and probably an iPad", "it sure would be cool to be able to sync those other products with your watch", "All those abilities would be nice"]}}
{"text": "Apple may launch its iWatch in the fall, according to Reuters, which reports that Taiwanese company Quanta will start production of the device in July. Citing two people familiar with the matter, Reuters reports that the as-yet-unnamed smartwatch could be launched as early as October. One of the sources said that the device will have a slightly rectangular display measuring 2.5 inches diagonally, a size which could indicate a curved design. The watch face will protrude slightly from the watch band, creating an arched shape, according to the source, and the device will offer a touch interface and wireless charging. Rumors of an Apple smartwatch, dubbed the iWatch, have swirled for years. Rival Samsung launched its Galaxy Gear watch last year, and unveiled its Gear 2 and Gear 2 Neo offerings in February. Described by Samsung as companion devices, the watches are compatible with the Korean tech giants Galaxy smartphones. The Gear 2 has a flat 1.63-inch inch display and comes with a 2 megapixel camera, a host of fitness features and a music player. Sony and Pebble are also playing in this space. Smartwatches, however, have not exactly generated massive consumer buzz. Nonetheless, tech research firm IDC predicts growing momentum in the overall wearable tech market, with device shipments expected to triple from 2013 to exceed 19 million units this year. The global market for wearable tech is expected to reach 111.9 million units in 2018, according to IDC. Smartwatches are part of this trend, which includes devices such as the Nike+ FuelBand. Set against the backdrop of a growing market, IDC says that demand for smartwatches will grow, but warns that the devices value preposition for consumers has not yet been fully clarified.

{"text": "Apple Inc. is ready to join Google Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. and a host of startups making smartwatches and, potentially, other wearable computing devices. But it isn't clear how much consumers want the devices. Those on the market so far haven't sold well, because most wearable devices only offer a limited set of features already found on a smartphone. Apple is planning multiple versions of a smartwatchdubbed the iWatch in the medialater this year, according to people familiar with the matter. The devices will include more than 10 sensors to track and monitor health and fitness data, these people said. Taiwanese manufacturer Quanta Computer Inc.  is expected to start producing the devices in two to three months, they said. As growth in smartphones and tablet computers slows, Apple and others are considering wearable devices as an enticing new market. Smaller sensors, flexible screens and ubiquitous wireless connectivity have the potential to usher in a new era of computing where all devices will become \"smart,\" collecting and processing data from daily life. So far, that hasn't led to big sales. World-wide shipments of wearable devicesincluding smartwatches and activity trackerstotaled about 2.9 million units in the first quarter, according to ABI Research. That is about 1% of the 300 million smartphones shipped during the same period. Apple said it alone sold 43.7 million iPhones in that quarter. Some industry watchers think Apple, with its record of success in defining new product segments with the iPhone and iPad, will crack the code.\nApple's ability to design both hardware and software gives it a leg up on competitors because it can present a cohesive vision for a new product, said Nick Spencer, an analyst at ABI Research. A person at one of Apple's component suppliers said the Cupertino, Calif., company expects to ship 10 million to 15 million smartwatches this year. By comparison, Apple sold 1.1 million iPhones in the first quarter it was available in 2007. \"We haven't really seen the big players come out with their best shot,\" said J.P. Gownder, an analyst at Forrester Research. \"No one has done anything completely serious.\" Apple spokeswoman Natalie Kerris declined to comment. Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive who has pledged to push the company into new product segments later this year, has expressed interest in wearable devices and sees it as an area worth exploring. \"There are lots of gadgets in this space right now, but there's nothing great out there,\" Mr. Cook said at a conference last year. \"There are a lot of problems to solve in this space.\" The new details of Apple's plans come ahead of Google's I/O conference for developers next week in San Francisco, where wearable devices are expected to be a major focus. Earlier this year, Google introduced Android Wear, a version of its Android operating system for wearables. LG Electronics Inc. and Motorolathe unit that Google agreed to sell to Lenovo Group Inc. for nearly $3 billionare expected to introduce watches running on Android Wear later this year. Samsung had used Android for its first Galaxy Gear smartwatch launched last year, but switched to Tizen, its homegrown operating system, for its second version, the Gear 2. Google's ambitions in wearable devices go beyond the wrist. Google Glass, the company's Web-connected eyewear, has garnered a lot of attention, much of it negative because of privacy concerns. The company also is working on a smart contact lens that it hopes will measure blood-sugar levels of diabetes sufferers by monitoring their tears. Already rivals in smartphone software, Apple and Google are expected to battle to control the health-related data collected by wearables. Earlier this month, Apple announced HealthKit, a system to collect and share data from various third-party wearable devices and apps. It also announced an app called Health to monitor that data on the iPhone. Google is expected to follow suit with a similar service at its conference next week. Despite the hype around wearable devices, mainstream adoption has been slow. Currently, the best-selling devices are activity trackers such as the Fitbit Force, Jawbone Up, Garmin Vivofit and Nike Inc.'s FuelBand. Earlier this year, Nike announced layoffs at the division responsible for the FuelBand, sparking speculation that the product wasn't selling well. Omar Siddiqui, chief executive of Kiwi, a developer of mobile games for Android and Apple's iOS, suggested that looking at today's sales is misleading because the applications that will attract users haven't been created yet. \"There are so many other use cases that we may not have thought of yet,\" he said. ABI Research's Mr. Spencer said applications will emerge once component makers produce parts designed specifically for wearable productsrather than repurposed smartphone partsto allow more design options. Mr. Spencer said there is currently too much focus on the watch. The true potential of wearable devices, he said, is in the data that they collect not necessarily in the shape of the hardware. Earlier this year, Intel Corp. Chief Executive Brian Krzanich unveiled a major push into wearable technology, showing off prototypes of new wearable devices developed by the company including a smartwatch and a smart earphone headset. He also announced a new chip called Edison aimed at wearable gadgets. \"We're looking at a broad ecosystem of wearables,\" Mr. Krzanich said during a speech at the CES technology conference in Las Vegas. Apple has hired a number of designers, engineers and executives from both the fashion industry and medical device world to work on its forthcoming smartwatch, said people familiar with the matter. The company has been working on ways to use advanced sensors to track a person's blood pressure and hydration levels, these people said. The recent hires include Michael O'Reilly, former chief medical officer of Masimo Corp., which makes a finger-sized device to measure oxygen in the blood without drawing blood. In December, Mr. O'Reilly accompanied a group of senior Apple executives to a meeting at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regarding \"mobile medical applications.\"", "label": {"what": ["Apple Inc. is ready to join Google Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. and a host of startups making smartwatches and, potentially, other wearable computing devices", "Those on the market so far haven't sold well", "Apple is planning multiple versions of a smartwatch dubbed the iWatch", "considering wearable devices as an enticing new market", "World-wide shipments of wearable devices including smartwatches and activity trackers totaled about 2.9 million units", "The new details of Apple's plans come ahead of Google's I/O conference for developers", "Google agreed to sell to Lenovo Group Inc. for nearly $3 billionare", "Samsung had used Android for its first Galaxy Gear smartwatch launched last year", "the company's Web-connected eyewear, has garnered a lot of attention", "Nike announced layoffs at the division responsible for the FuelBand", "Intel Corp.

The Wall Street Journal also said Friday that Apple Inc. is planning multiple screen sizes for the device, which some people have dubbed the iWatch. Samsung, Sony, Qualcomm and others have already released smartwatches, but the gadgets have mostly functioned as companions to smartphones, offering email notifications, clock functions and the like. Samsung's Gear 2 line, released this year, added fitness-related apps and has a heart rate sensor. There's been longstanding speculation that Apple has been working on a smartwatch. The main question has been when it would come out. Apple intensified speculation this month when it said the upcoming version of its mobile operating system, iOS 8, will include tools for managing health data. The software is expected in September, along with new iPhones. Apple has been under pressure to release new products, as investors question whether the company that popularized the smartphone and the tablet computer is still able to innovate following the death of co-founder Steve Jobs. CEO Tim Cook has hinted at new products coming this year, but the company hasn't provided details. Citing unnamed people familiar with the matter, the Journal said production of the smartwatch is expected to begin in two or three months at Quanta Computer Inc., a Taiwanese company that has worked on Apple's Mac computers.

Sources said Apple will introduce a smartwatch with a display about 6 cm in diameter with a touch face and wireless charging. There will likely be multiple versions of the device, offering functions that might be different from a smartphone. There may also be differing designs, as watches are fashion items. Apple has hired a former chief executive of French fashion house Yves Saint Laurent, Paul Deneve, for what it called \"special projects.\" Among the likely functions are sensors to track health and fitness, including heart rate. Apple showed its interest in health and fitness-tracking last month with a new app called Health, designed to collect all of a user's fitness and health data in one spot Apples entry into the wearable device market is hotly anticipated, though it is behind rivals such as Google Inc. and Samsung Electronics. It is hoped that Apples device will be the breakthrough that makes smartwatches into widely popular devices, just as the introduction of iPhone built the smartphone market. Apple's watch will be able to perform some functions independently, but tasks like messaging and voice chat will require connection to a smartphone or other device run on Apples iOS operating system.

Google will kick off its annual Google I/O conference for developers on June 25. The company is expected to unveil an updated version of its Android OS for smartphones and tablets. It will also put major focus on wearables with its Android Wear OS. LG's G Watch and Motorola's Moto 360 smart watches are expected to receive major stage time, and those two devices are sure to be Apple's upcoming iWatch's main competitors.

The source is also claiming that the iWatch will feature a display built by LG. It will use a larger 2.5-inch display than the 1.5-inch size stated in numerous reports. The 1.5-inch display matched Apple's 6th-generation and first touch-screen iPod nano, which was released in 2010.

{"text": "A powerful storm with tornadoes ripped through northeast Nebraska on Monday, destroying more than half of the tiny town of Pilger, killing a 5-year-old child and injuring at least 19 people, hospital and emergency officials said. The National Weather Service said at least two twisters touched down within roughly 1.5 kilometres of each other. Emergency crews and residents spent the evening sorting through demolished homes and businesses in the town of about 350, roughly 160 kilometres northwest of Omaha. \"I have never seen twin tornadoes like this,\" CBC News meteorologist Johanna Wagstaffe said of the twisters near the towns of Stanton and Pilger. She estimated winds would be faster than 300 km/h. \"From what I'm seeing on the radar, these two tornadoes actually merged later on, and it continues to skip, touching on and off the ground  as we move towards Iowa,\" she added. 'Total devastation' \"More than half of the town is gone  absolutely gone,\" Stanton County Commissioner Jerry Weatherholt said. \"The co-op is gone, the grain bins are gone, and it looks like almost every house in town has some damage. It's a complete mess.\" Victims were taken to three regional hospitals, and at least one had died from unspecified injuries, hospital officials said. Jodi Richey, a spokeswoman for Faith Regional Health Services in nearby Norfolk, said one person died and 16 others were being treated at the hospital. Hospital officials initially described those patients as being in critical condition, but said later that some had been released after treatment. The Stanton County Sheriff's Office confirmed late Monday that the person killed was a 5-year-old child. It didn't specify the child's gender. One was transferred to a trauma center in Omaha, while others required surgery, said Dr. Doug Dilly, who was in the emergency room when patients arrived. Providence Medical Center in nearby Wayne treated three tornado patients, including two who had lacerations, said hospital spokeswoman Sandy Bartling. Two were released Monday evening, and the third patient was in stable condition, she said. Stanton County Sheriff Mike Unger estimated that 50 to 75 per cent of Pilger was heavily damaged or destroyed in the storm. The local school is likely beyond repair, he said. \"It's total devastation,\" Unger said. Authorities said the first tornado touched down around 3:45 p.m. and downed several power lines before it leveled a farmhouse. Four people were trapped inside. While local crews removed them from the debris, a second tornado was spotted southwest of Pilger, according to the Stanton County Sheriff's Office. Shortly afterward, the town suffered a \"direct hit\" that leveled several buildings, including the Fire Department building, the sheriff's office said. Several people near Main Street in Pilger suffered critical injuries, including the child who later died. Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman declared a state of emergency, and the National Guard was preparing to deploy to assist local emergency responders and help with the cleanup. The Nebraska Emergency Management Agency was expected to arrive in town Tuesday morning. Residents evacuated Pilger was evacuated for the night, and the Nebraska State Patrol closed all roads into town. Most residents made their own arrangements, but some were taken to a shelter at Wisner-Pilger Jr.-Sr. High School in nearby Wisner. About a dozen residents had arrived at the makeshift shelter by 9:30 p.m., and school officials were expecting more to come later, said Wisner-Pilger Schools Superintendent Chad Boyer. The shelter will remain open to residents for as long as needed to offer food, water, showers and cots, he said. Tornadoes also caused damage in Cuming and Wayne counties, the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency said in a news release. \"We are still in a response mode in these communities,\" said Earl Imler, NEMA's operations officer. \"We are collecting damage reports from local officials on the ground.\" CBC News Weather Centre's Ross Hull said the areas most affected by the storm system later in the evening will be southern Wisconsin and northern Iowa. The worst of the storm is likely over, however, with the tornado activity forecast to weaken overnight, Hull said. Officials won't know the intensity of the storms until late Tuesday at the earliest, after crews have examined the area, said Barbara Mayes, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Valley. Mayes said the dual tornadoes were unusual because both appeared to have roughly the same strength. In most cases, she said, one tornado tends to be larger and more powerful than the other, and the bigger cyclone grows stronger as the smaller one weakens. \"It's less common for two tornadoes to track together for so long, especially with that same intensity,\" she said. \"By no means is it unprecedented. But we don't see it often.\" Meteorologists with the National Weather Service also tracked a tornado near the town of Burwell, in central Nebraska.

Officials surveying the damage on Tuesday said that as much as three-quarters of the town  population 378  had been destroyed or partly damaged, including houses, a school, a fire station and a church. A side of the two-story bank, where the employees had huddled, had been shorn away. While the phenomenon of twin tornadoes is not all that rare, what made it unusual was that the two tornadoes appeared to have been of a similar size, said Greg Carbin, a warning coordination meteorologist at the Storm Prediction Center of the National Weather Service. Also unusual, Mr. Carbin said, is that the tornadoes were captured on video, footage played frequently throughout the day on both television and the Internet. It is rare to capture in a photo nature in that type of formation, he said. Often, if two tornadoes appear in proximity, one will be significantly larger because as one picks up strength, the other dissipates. The National Weather Service had crews on the ground at daybreak on Tuesday trying to gauge the precise speed and path of the tornadoes and whether they eventually merged into a single tornado, as some Pilger residents claimed. Preliminary data suggested wind speeds were as high as 165 miles per hour, said Van DeWald, a National Weather Service meteorologist. In Pilger, emergency crews spent much of the day making sure the village was safe  searching for fallen power lines, gas leaks and chemical spills. Gov. Dave Heineman, who declared a state of emergency and activated the Nebraska National Guard to aid in the recovery effort, toured the village and pledged to help it rebuild. Residents, who had been evacuated after the tornado hit, were briefly allowed back into their homes to pack clothes or to salvage what they could. With no water or electricity available, residents spent Tuesday night elsewhere. Some stayed in a shelter in nearby Wisner, while others relied on friends and family. Cleanup, officials said, will begin in earnest on Wednesday. Barb Wolverton, 50, and her 15-year-old daughter, LeAnna, took shelter in their basement during the storm. Even with her hearing loss, Ms. Wolverton could hear debris striking the side of their home. While their property suffered only minor damage, other homes on the same block were completely destroyed. We came out and just looked around and you couldnt even believe your eyes, she said. It was hard to even comprehend. It was hard to absorb. I got my iPhone out and I just started taking pictures because I knew that I wasnt absorbing what I was seeing. Larry Wilson, 73, who has lived here for 22 years, took cover at his neighbors home and returned to find his own house destroyed. The storm built up in about 45 minutes, he said, and it was just different. He added, I just had a feeling that this thing was going to do something. When he was at his neighbors house, Mr. Wilson said: I thought at any time the roof was just going to come off and it was going to be light out. But it didnt. By the time we got outside it was across town.

{"text": "A powerful storm with tornadoes ripped through northeast Nebraska on Monday, destroying more than half of the tiny town of Pilger, killing a 5-year-old child and injuring at least 19 people, hospital and emergency officials said. The National Weather Service said dual twisters touched down within roughly a mile (1.6 kilometers) of each other. Emergency crews and residents spent the evening sorting through demolished homes and businesses in the community of about 350, roughly 100 miles (160 kilometers) northwest of Omaha. \"More than half of the town is gone - absolutely gone,\" Stanton County Commissioner Jerry Weatherholt said. \"The co-op is gone, the grain bins are gone, and it looks like almost every house in town has some damage. It's a complete mess.\" Victims were taken to three regional hospitals, and at least one had died from unspecified injuries, hospital officials said. Jodi Richey, a spokeswoman for Faith Regional Health Services in nearby Norfolk, said one person died and 16 others were being treated at the hospital. Hospital officials initially described those patients as being in critical condition, but said later that some had been released after treatment. The Stanton County Sheriff's Office confirmed late Monday that the person killed was a 5-year-old child. It didn't specify the child's gender. One was transferred to a trauma center in Omaha, while others required surgery, said Dr. Doug Dilly, who was in the emergency room when patients arrived. Providence Medical Center in nearby Wayne treated three tornado patients, including two who had lacerations, said hospital spokeswoman Sandy Bartling. Two were released Monday evening, and the third patient was in stable condition, she said. Stanton County Sheriff Mike Unger estimated that 50 to 75 percent of Pilger was heavily damaged or destroyed in the storm. The local school is likely beyond repair, he said. \"It's total devastation,\" Unger said. Authorities said the first tornado touched down around 3:45 p.m. and downed several power lines before it leveled a farmhouse. Four people were trapped inside. While local crews removed them from the debris, a second tornado was spotted southwest of Pilger, according to the Stanton County Sheriff's Office. Shortly afterward, the town suffered a \"direct hit\" that leveled several buildings, including the Fire Department building, the sheriff's office said. Several people near Main Street in Pilger suffered critical injuries, including the child who later died. Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman declared a state of emergency, and the National Guard was preparing to assist local emergency responders and help with the cleanup. Heineman and officials with the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency were expected to arrive Tuesday morning. Pilger was evacuated for the night, and the Nebraska State Patrol closed all roads into town. Most residents made their own arrangements, but some were taken to a shelter at Wisner-Pilger Jr.-Sr. High School in nearby Wisner. About a dozen residents had arrived at the makeshift shelter by 9:30 p.m., and school officials were expecting more to come later, said Wisner-Pilger Schools Superintendent Chad Boyer. The shelter will remain open to residents for as long as needed to offer food, water, showers and cots, he said. Tornadoes also caused damage in Cuming and Wayne counties, the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency said in a news release. \"We are still in a response mode in these communities,\" said Earl Imler, NEMA's operations officer. \"We are collecting damage reports from local officials on the ground.\" Officials won't know the intensity of the storms until late Tuesday at the earliest, after crews have examined the area, said Barbara Mayes, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Valley. Mayes said the dual tornadoes were unusual because both appeared to have roughly the same strength. In most cases, she said, one tornado tends to be larger and more powerful than the other, and the bigger cyclone grows stronger as the smaller one weakens. \"It's less common for two tornadoes to track together for so long, especially with that same intensity,\" she said. \"By no means is it unprecedented. But we don't see it often.\" Meteorologists with the National Weather Service also tracked a tornado near the town of Burwell, in central Nebraska.

Pilger saw significant damage to a school, a bank and a church in town, and many homes in the southern portion of the town were destroyed or damaged. \"More than half of the town is gone - absolutely gone,\" Mr Weatherholt said. \"The co-op is gone, the grains bins are gone, and it looks like almost every house in town has some damage. It's a complete mess.\" Faith Regional Health Services hospital spokeswoman Jodi Richey told the Associated Press news agency one person had died and 16 were being treated for injuries. Providence Medical Center in nearby Wayne also treated three hurt by the tornado, two who have been already released, hospital spokeswoman Sandy Bartling said. The governor of the state has declared an emergency, which will allow the use of Nebraska's National Guard.

{"text": "As two giant tornadoes bore down on this tiny farming town in northeast Nebraska, Trey Wisniewski heard the storm sirens, glanced out at the blackening sky and rushed with his wife into their basement. \"My wife was holding our animals, and I was holding on to my wife. We could feel the suction try to pull us out of there,\" he said Tuesday. Suddenly, their house was gone, leaving them to dodge debris that rained down upon them. And then, the storm that hit so suddenly Monday afternoon was gone, allowing them to emerge and see what was left of the 350-person farming town of Pilger. They found that much of the community was gone and two people had died. The disaster, delivered by twin twisters rare in how forcefully they travelled side by side for an extended period, left some townsfolk doubting whether the town could rebuild, even as they marveled that the death toll hadn't been worse. \"This is by far the worst thing I've ever seen as governor,\" said Gov. Dave Heineman, who flew over Pilger in a helicopter Tuesday morning and then walked through the town, trailed by reporters. One of those killed was a 5-year-old girl, Calista Dixon, said Stanton County Sheriff Mike Unger. Cody Murphree, the girl's brother, said in a statement that his mother, 42-year-old Kandi Murphree, was in a medically induced coma in Omaha after the tornado destroyed their home. The other fatality was a motorist killed during the storm, David A. Herout, 74, of Clarkson, Nebraska. He died in Cuming County, a few miles east of Pilger. At least 19 people were taken to hospitals. Up to 75 percent of the buildings in Pilger were heavily damaged or destroyed. The tornado destroyed much of the small downtown, leaving piles of bricks that had been storefronts in the street. Several grain bins on the south end of Main Street were swept away, and others remained crumpled on the ground. Between 45 and 50 homes in Pilger were demolished, about a dozen others were damaged beyond repair in Dixon County. Homes south and west of downtown fared even worse, with most reduced to piles of debris or gone entirely. \"I am amazed that ... out of all of this destruction only two people were killed,\" Wisniewski said. While the governor said he was confident the community would rebuild, cafe owner Linda Oertwich wasn't so sure. \"Pilger's too small and the devastation in these homes will cost too much to rebuild,\" said Oertwich, who will decide whether to rebuild her Village Bar and Cafe after hearing from her insurance company. The tornado swept away the house Larry Nelson, 73, had lived in for 23 years, leaving nothing but the cinderblock foundation. Because he didn't have a basement, Nelson rushed to a neighbor's house when sirens sounded. \"I'm grateful that I was over there,\" Nelson said, pointing to his neighbor's house. The storm was part of a larger system that tracked across the nation's midsection Monday. Pilger was hit by one of twin twisters, which roared for miles through northeast Nebraska. The tornadoes were of roughly equal size, about a mile apart. The northern twister, confirmed as an EF4 tornado, struck the town before the two merged, according to the National Weather Service. The storm appears to have produced four tornadoes in all, said Van DeWald, lead meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Valley, Nebraska. It was the size and intensity of the dual tornadoes that made them rare, said Nebraska State Climatologist Al Dutcher, noting that usually one tornado weakens and shrinks in such a situation. Dutcher said a lack of thunderstorms helped increase the tornadoes' strength because they had no competition for wind and moisture in the atmosphere. \"It speaks wonders about the amount of instability that was in the atmosphere,\" Dutcher said. \"This was a highly volatile situation where once something got going, it really got going.\" Authorities said the first tornado touched down around 3:45 p.m. and downed several power lines before it leveled a farmhouse. The second tornado was spotted southwest of Pilger, according to the Stanton County Sheriff's Office. Shortly afterward, the town suffered a \"direct hit\" that leveled several buildings, including the Fire Department building. Heineman declared a state of emergency, and the National Guard was preparing to assist local emergency responders and help with the cleanup. A shelter for displaced residents was established at Wisner-Pilger Jr.-Sr. High School in nearby Wisner.

{"text": "Multiple tornadoes pummeled a region in northeast Nebraska Monday, killing one and causing damage that was still being assessed as the sun went down. And the severe weather is not letting up. A tornado watch remains in place until early Tuesday morning. One city, Pilger, has been closed to all but emergency personnel, the state's emergency management agency said Monday night. Severe weather in the area caused damage in at least four towns -- Pilger, Wisner, Stanton and Pender, according to the governor's office. At least 15 patients were transported to Faith Regional Health Services for treatment, and \"many more\" were expected to arrive, hospital spokeswoman Jacque Genovese said. Officials were assessing the damage, trying to determine how many are injured and how much damage has been done. \"We're still digging people out,\" said Sanford Goshorn, the emergency manager in Stanton County, where Pilger and Stanton are located. Wisner is in Cuming County, and Pender in Thurston County. In the immediate aftermath of the tornadoes, it was unclear how many touched down in this corner of Nebraska. But at least two major tornadoes touched down at the same time, CNN Meteorologist Chad Myers said. The two tornadoes -- side by side and straddling a road -- were a menacing sight. The state emergency management agency reported \"severe damage\" across the affected counties. \"We are still in a response mode in these communities,\" emergency management operations officer Earl Imler said. \"We are collecting damage reports from local officials on the ground.\" Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman issued a state of emergency, putting the National Guard on standby. According to the governor's office, the reported fatality happened when a tornado picked up a car and dropped it. The National Weather Service also issued a tornado emergency warning for the town of Burwell, located in Garfield County, where a confirmed \"large, violent and extremely dangerous tornado\" was sighted. The storm included hail and residents in its path were urged to take immediate cover. Damage from the storm also reached the area of the Nebraska-Iowa border. \"We've had reports of brief touchdowns as the storms near Sioux City, Iowa,\" said National Weather Service Meteorologist Todd Heitkamp said. \"We've had widespread wind and flooding damage due to the series of storms that have been ongoing today.

{"text": "Becky Hauf had always been told her little town of Pilger, Nebraska, would never see a tornado. Too close to the Elkhorn River, the folklore went. Instead, Pilger got two. At the same time. The rare twin tornadoes that spun through on Monday night wiped out the town's business district, obliterated its fire station and ground 40 or 50 homes into rubble, Stanton County Sheriff Mike Unger said. As much as three-fourths of the town of 350 is gone, Unger said. Two people died during the storm -- one a 5-year-old. The second death -- a traffic accident -- was probably weather-related, Unger said. Faith Regional Health Services in Norfolk said 16 people were critically injured in the storms. In southern Wisconsin, a line of thunderstorms that spawned twisters rolled through late Monday and early Tuesday. The town of Madison was hit hard. Mayor Paul Soglin said about 25 homes were damaged by the storm, which caused about $10 million in damages, reported CNN affiliate WKOW. The National Weather Service said it appeared a tornado touched down and lifted several times in the Mineral Point and Verona areas. At least 19 homes in Verona, near Madison, were damaged so badly they were uninhabitable, WKOW reported. The weather service said two tornadoes touched down in Plateville. No deaths were reported. In Nebraska, severe weather also caused damage in the towns of Wisner, Stanton and Pender. All four communities are within about 40 miles (64 kilometers) of one another, about an hour and a half northwest of Omaha. The National Weather Service also received unconfirmed tornado reports from Iowa, North Dakota and in Wisconsin, where emergency workers were searching homes in Madison and Verona after possible wind damage there, according to police. There were no reports of injuries or deaths, authorities said. The risk of severe weather will linger into Tuesday. Portions of 17 states, from Montana to Massachusetts, were at slight risk of severe storms Tuesday, including the possibility of a few tornadoes, the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center said. No watches or warnings were in effect Tuesday afternoon. Back in Pilger, storm chasers captured dramatic video of the twin tornadoes tearing through the countryside. At one point, the twisters straddled a state highway. \"It was terribly wide,\" Marianne Pesotta told CNN affiliate KETV-TV. \"I drove east (to escape). I could see how bad it was. I had to get out of there.\" Hauf and other employees of the Farmers Co-op in Pilger rode out the storm in the convenience store's cooler. \"It seemed like forever, but I guess it was only a couple minutes, and it was coming down on top of us,\" Hauf told CNN's \"New Day. \"But the coolers held together wonderfully.\" When she emerged, the first thing she noticed was the condition of the stock in the store where she'd worked for 20 years. \"I guess the first thing I saw was a ... cupcake box and a 24-pack of Bud Light,\" she said.

{"text": "Some one billion people are now using Android devices, Google said as the company kicked off its two-day developer conference Wednesday in San Francisco. But the online search leader's effort to broaden its focus beyond smartphones and tablets was on full display as the company unveiled far-reaching plans to push further into the living room, the family car and the TV set. As part of a nearly three-hour opening presentation, Google gave more details about Android Wear, a version of the operating system customized for wearable gadgets such as smartwatches. The company also introduced Android Auto, which has been tailored to work with cars. Android TV, meanwhile, is optimized for TV-watching, aided by a recommendation system and voice searches for things like \"Breaking Bad\" or \"Oscar-nominated movies from 2002.\" About 6,000 developers, bloggers and journalists flocked to the event. Following Google's recent revelation that showed that just 30 per cent of its employees are women, the company touted that the number of women attending its conference grew to 20 per cent this year from eight per cent a year earlier. The event was interrupted at several points by protesters who were quickly escorted out. Google has been the subject of disapproval for its use of shuttle buses to ferry its employees from San Francisco to its Mountain View headquarters. The buses have become a symbol of the divide between Silicon Valley's tech millionaires and those left out of the latest boom. Transition to smartphones Google's I/O event a rally of sorts designed to get developers excited about creating apps and devices for Google's ecosystem comes at a time of transition for the company, which makes most of its money from advertising thanks to its status as the world's leader in online search. The company is trying to adjust to an ongoing shift to smartphones and tablet computers from desktop and laptop PCs. Though mobile advertising is growing rapidly, advertising aimed at PC users still generates more money. At the same time, Google is angling to stay at the forefront of innovation by taking gambles on new, sometimes unproven technologies that take years to pay off if at all. Driverless cars, Google Glass, smartwatches and thinking thermostats are just some of its more far-off bets. On the home front, Google's Nest Labs which makes network-connected thermostats and smoke detectors announced earlier this week that it has created a program that allows outside developers, from tiny startups to large companies such as Whirlpool and Mercedes-Benz, to fashion software and \"new experiences\" for its products. Integration with Mercedes-Benz, for example, might mean that a car can notify a Nest thermostat when it's getting close to home, so the device can have the home's temperature adjusted to the driver's liking before he or she arrives. Nest's founder, Tony Fadell, is an Apple veteran who helped design the iPod and the iPhone. Google bought the company earlier this year for $3.2 billion. Nest and other home devices Opening the Nest platform to outside developers will allow Google to move into the emerging market for connected, smart home devices. Experts expect that this so-called \"Internet of Things\" phenomenon will change the way people use technology in much the same way that smartphones have changed life since the introduction of Apple's iPhone seven years ago. In March, Google released \"Android Wear,\" a version of its operating system tailored to computerized wristwatches and other wearable devices. Although there are already several smartwatches on the market, the devices are more popular with gadget geeks and fitness fanatics than regular consumers. But Google could help change that with Android Wear. Android, after all, is already the world's most popular smartphone operating system. At I/O, the company announced three new smartwatches running Android Wear. The LG G and the Samsung Gear Live are available on Wednesday. A third one, Motorola's Moto 360, is coming later this summer  an announcement that drew groans from the audience, which had hoped for an earlier date. Intent on reaching the billions of people who don't have a smartphone or even Internet access, Google also unveiled an initiative called Android One, designed to help manufacturers build low-cost smartphones for emerging markets such as India. The company also showed off features of the next version of Android, which goes by the temporary code name \"Android L.\" It's been designed to work across all devices as long as the gadgets are running the operating system, so a user can check email on a smartwatch, answer the message on a smartphone and then delete it on a computer, for example. Android L will also look different, include more animation, colours and a feature called \"material design,\" which lets developers add shadows and seams to give visuals on a phone's screen the appearance of depth.", "label": {"what": ["Someone billion people are now using Android devices, Google said as the company kicked off its two-day developer conference Wednesday in San Francisco",

{"text": "An Android update, wearable gadgets and so-called smart home devices are just some of the innovations Google is likely to show off at its two-day developer conference, which begins Wednesday in San Francisco. In recent years, the conference has focused on smartphones and tablets, but this year Google's Android operating system is expected to stretch  into cars, homes and smartwatches. Pacific Crest analyst Evan Wilson believes Google will unveil a new version of its Android operating system  possibly called Lollipop  with a \"heavy focus\" on extensions for smartwatches and smart home devices. \"We think Google will directly counter Apple's recent announcements of health products (Apple HealthKit) and home automation (Apple HomeKit),\" Wilson wrote in a note to investors. Google's I/O event comes at a time of transition for the company, which makes most of its money from advertising thanks to its status as the world's leader in online search. The company is trying to adjust to an ongoing shift to smartphones and tablet computers from desktop and laptop PCs. Though mobile advertising is growing rapidly, advertising aimed at PC users still generates more money. At the same time, Google is angling to stay at the forefront of innovation by taking gambles on new, sometimes unproven technologies that take years to pay off  if at all. Driverless cars, Google Glass, smartwatches and thinking thermostats are just some of its more far-off bets. On the home front, Google's Nest Labs  which makes network-connected thermostats and smoke detectors  announced earlier this week that it has created a program that allows outside developers, from tiny startups to large companies such as Whirlpool and Mercedes-Benz, to fashion software and \"new experiences\" for its products. Integration with Mercedes-Benz, for example, might mean that a car can notify a Nest thermostat when it's getting close to home, so the device can have the home's temperature adjusted to the driver's liking before he or she arrives. Nest's founder, Tony Fadell, is an Apple veteran who helped design the iPod and the iPhone. Google bought the company earlier this year for $3.2 billion. Opening the Nest platform to outside developers will allow Google to move into the emerging market for connected, smart home devices. Experts expect that this so-called \"Internet of Things\" phenomenon will change the way people use technology in much the same way that smartphones have changed life since the introduction of Apple's iPhone seven years ago. Google is also likely to unveil some advances in wearable technology. In March, Google released \"Android Wear,\" a version of its operating system tailored to computerized wristwatches and other wearable devices. Although there are already several smartwatches on the market, the devices are more popular with gadget geeks and fitness fanatics than regular consumers. But Google could help change that with Android Wear. Android, after all, is already the world's most popular smartphone operating system. Google may also have news about Glass, including when the company might launch a new and perhaps less expensive version of the $1,500 Internet-connected eyewear. Google will likely have to lower the price if it wants Glass to reach a broader audience. But that's just one hurdle.

{"text": "Google has unveiled the next version of its Android software for smartphones and tablets: Android 5.0 L. Announced at the company's annual I/O developer conference in San Francisco, the software will be released in the autumn. It will be preloaded on new Android devices, although manufacturers and mobile operators will dictate when it is downloadable for older ones. Key features in Android L include a new \"material design\" look and feel, improved battery life and enhanced notifications. \"This is one of the most comprehensive releases we have done: it has over 5,000 new APIs, and we are thinking not just for mobile, but for form factors beyond mobile,\" said Google's Android and Chrome boss Sundar Pichai, during the keynote presentation at I/O. Key to these changes will be a new look and feel across smartphones, tablets and other devices, dubbed \"material design\" by Google's design chief Matias Duarte, during the keynote. \"What if pixels didn't just have colour, but also depth? What if there was an intelligent material that was as simple as paper, but could transform and change shape in response to touch?\" said Duarte. \"We drew inspiration from paper and ink, but unlike real paper, digital material can expand, reform and reshape.\" Google claimed that L will be significantly faster than previous versions, including when running on existing Android devices like the Nexus 5 smartphone. It will also support 64-bit processors, matching Apple's latest devices. Meanwhile, a Google initiative called Project Volta has focused on improving battery life on Android devices, including a new \"Battery Saver\" mode that the company says could give users up to 90 minutes more battery life over the course of a typical day, for some devices. Google is improving the notifications feature on Android, with users able to read, open and dismiss notifications from the lock-screen of their devices. The software will also try to learn from users' behaviour, in order to judge which notifications are most important for them. L will also have a centralised setting called Universal Data Control, where Android users will be able to control how data on their handset is shared. Users will also be able to divide their devices between work and personal modes. \"In the PC world, companies gave you a separate laptop for work, and your own personal laptop... that model starts breaking down when you start talking about phones. Nobody wants to carry two phones around,\" said Pichai, of the new feature. \"We are doing it thoughtfully by providing underlying data separation: all your personal data is isolated from your corporate stuff, and vice versa.\" Earlier in the keynote, Pichai said that Android now has 1bn \"30-day active users\"  people who've used an Android device in the last month  up from nearly 530m a year ago. He also claimed that Android now has a 62% global market share of tablet shipments, fending off past potshots from Apple that many of those devices are not being used by citing stats from Google's YouTube video service. Android accounted for 28% of its tablet viewers in May 2013, but is now up to 42%. \"We aren't building a vertically integrated product. What we are doing is building an open platform at scale. We work with hundreds of partners globally to bring a product and a platform that touches billions of people. And we want to do it in a way in which we are innovating at a very very fast pace,\" said Pichai. He also took a shot at Apple, which has recently added some new features to its iOS software that were already in Android. \"Custom keyboards, widgets. Those things happened in Android four to five years ago. We are working very hard to bring an open platform and innovate on it at an unprecedented scale,\" said Pichai.", "label": {"what": ["Google has unveiled the next version of its Android software for smartphones and tablets", "Google claimed that L will be significantly faster than previous versions", "L will also have a centralised setting called Universal Data Control", "Those things happened in Android four to five years ago."], "when": ["in the autumn", "during the keynote presentation", "during the keynote", "Meanwhile", "90 minutes", "a typical day", "Earlier", "30-day", "in the last month", "up from nearly 530m a year ago", "in May 2013", "recently", "four to five years ago"], "where": ["at the company's annual I/O developer conference", "in San Francisco", "on new Android devices", "at I/O.", "on their handset", "In the PC world", "in the keynote", "from Google's YouTube video service", "at Apple", "in Android"], "why": ["it has over 5,000 new APIs", "thinking not just for mobile, but for form factors beyond mobile", "drew inspiration from paper and ink", "judge which notifications are most important for them", "start talking about phones", "those devices are not being used", "has recently added some new features to its iOS software that were already in Android.", "bring an open platform and innovate on it at an unprecedented scale"], "who": ["Google", "manufacturers and mobile operators", "older ones", "factors beyond mobile", "Google's Android and Chrome boss Sundar Pichai", "Google's design chief Matias Duarte", "a Google initiative called Project Volta", "Android users", "Users", "1bn '30-day active users' people", "its tablet viewers", "hundreds of partners", "touches billions of people"], "how": ["It will be preloaded on new Android devices", "This is one of the most comprehensive releases we have done", "Key to these changes will be a new look and feel across smartphones, tablets and other devices", "in response to touch", "digital material can expand, reform and reshape", "by providing underlying data separation", "all your personal data is isolated from your corporate stuff, and vice versa", "What we are doing is building an open platform at scale", "we are innovating at a very very fast pace"], "product name": ["Android 5.0 L.", "the Nexus 5 smartphone", "Apple's latest devices", "'Battery Saver' mode", "Universal Data Control", "work and personal modes"], "countermeasures": ["unveiled the next version of its Android software", "has focused on improving battery life on Android devices", "The software will also try to learn from users' behaviour", "gave you a separate laptop for work, and your own personal laptop", "work with hundreds of partners globally to bring a product and a platform", "took a shot at Apple", "are working very hard"], "new features": ["a new 'material design' look and feel", "improved battery life", "enhanced notifications", "pixels didn't just have colour, but also depth", "an intelligent material that was as simple as paper, but could transform and change shape in response to touch", "support 64-bit processors, matching Apple's latest devices", "divide their devices between work and personal modes"], "effects": ["give users up to 90 minutes more battery life over the course of a typical day, for some devices", "Android users will be able to control how data on their handset is shared", "Users will also be able to divide their devices between work and personal modes", "Nobody wants to carry two phones around", "Android now has 1bn '30-day active users' people", "Android now has a 62% global market share of tablet shipments", "Android accounted for 28% of its tablet viewers", "but is now up to 42%"]}}
{"text": "Google's annual developer conference  Google I/O  begins on Wednesday evening UK time  and expectations are high for a new version of Android, a fresh assault on TV, and a focus on wearables and fitness. A keynote session led by Sundar Pichai, in charge of both Android and Chrome, will introduce the new technology and services that the company has been working on. Coming just weeks after Apple's similar WWDC event, the I/O keynote will offer the latest chance to compare the fierce rivals' strategies across a range of devices, from smartphones and tablets to wearable gadgets, connected cars and home automation kit. Google has already confirmed that it will show the next version of its Android software during the keynote, while strong speculation suggests there will also be a new activity-tracking platform called Google Fit; more details and some devices from the Android Wear wearables programme; and a new move into connected TV called Android TV, possibly with a set-top box to show it off. But this being Google, there are plenty of other areas of its business that may get the spotlight tonight: Glass, YouTube music, Project Ara, Google Fiber, Project Loon... Here are a few predictions on what's likely to be talked about on-stage. 1. Android 5.0  Lollipop? We know the next version of Android will be shown off, because Pichai has said so, in a profile by Bloomberg Businessweek. It's earlier than expected based on previous versions - possibly to give handset makers time to incorporate it into new devices for Christmas sales. \"I want the world to understand what we are doing sooner,\" said Pichai. Speculation is already underway about what sweet treat beginning with 'L' will give the new software its name, following Cupcake, Donut, Eclair, Froyo, Gingerbread, Honeycomb, Ice Cream Sandwich, Jelly Bean and KitKat. The current favourite is Lollipop, but curveballs could include Lemon Meringue Pie, Liquorice or  for optimistic Brits  Lion Bar. More importantly, what will the key features be? More design tweaks are likely, and there has been lots of speculation that Android 5.0 will introduce support for 64-bit processors from companies like Qualcomm and Intel, for faster and more powerful devices. Google Now software will surely get some clever new features. There has been speculation about a wider feature called Nearby, which \"lets you connect, share, and do more with people, places, and things near you\"  a way for Android devices to connect and swap data when within range. Perhaps a counterfoil to Apple's iBeacon technology? Google will hopefully outline its next improvements for its Google Play store  although the latter has tended to get bits and bobs added throughout the year, rather than following Apple's model of a bigger annual update. Also see Android Police's story this week about plans for a new Quick Settings pane - which looks a bit like Samsung's quick settings pane. The nitty-gritty of Android 5.0 may be about these kinds of small, iterative but welcome changes to the operating system. 2. Android Wear Google's ambitions to make Android the most popular software for wearable gadgets through Android Wear are already public. Pichai himself announced the plans at the SXSW conference in March: \"In about two weeks, you will see us launch the first SDK for what we think of as Android for wearables. When we think of wearables, we think of it as a platform. We see a world of sensors... Sensors can be small and powerful, and gather a lot of information that can be useful for users. We want to build the right APIs for this world of sensors.\" The SDK was launched later that month, as promised, along with first partners: Samsung, Asus, HTC, LG, Fossil and Motorola, with the latter showing off renders of its Moto 360 smartwatch. The emphasis then was on watches, including voice commands, fitness tracking and the ability to control other devices from your wrist. No secrets here, but I/O should be a coming-out party for Android Wear: we expect more devices to be shown  the LG G Watch has already been shown to journalists and appears to be gearing up for a 7 July release date. I/O may be the time for Google to show off other kinds of wearable devices running Android Wear too: pure (i.e. non-watch) activity-trackers, for example. 3. Google Fit One of the big announcements at Apple's WWDC conference was HealthKit, a feature in that company's upcoming iOS 8 software that will scoop in data from various health and fitness apps and systems and even records and share it back out to others  complete with a Health app for users to keep tabs on it all. Apple isn't alone in these ambitions: Google has been strongly tipped to unveil something called Google Fit at I/O. Pichai said in the BusinessWeek interview that You obviously need to be able to measure these [fitness and health] things so many more times and then apply more intelligence to it\". Forbes claimed an exclusive on the plans earlier in June, suggesting that it will also involve aggregating data from third-party fitness and health apps: \"Google Fit will aggregate data through open APIs, instruction sets that allow apps to share information, and will also announce partnerships with wearable device makers at its I/O conference, Forbes understands. One source with knowledge of Googles plans said Google Fit would allow a wearable device that measures data like steps or heart rate to interface with Googles cloud-based services, and become part of the Google Fit ecosystem.\" Assuming Google Fit is announced tonight, it's likely to be closely tied to Android Wear, albeit also drawing in devices running other software. If there's a standalone Google-branded fitness app  the equivalent to Apple's health  it may be part of the Android 5.0 software. 4. Android TV Google has had ambitions in the living room for a long time now, particularly around televisions. In 2011, those ambitions were focused on the Google TV software for connected TVs and set-top boxes, but it failed to take off. More recently, Google's Chromecast dongle has been a hit, enabling people to send content to their TVs via their Android smartphones or tablets, or the Chrome browser. Next: Android TV, if strong speculation is to be believed. The Verge bagged some leaked documents in April providing some of the details, in Google's own words: \"Android TV is an entertainment interface, not a computing platform. Its all about finding and enjoying content with the least amount of friction... cinematic, fun, fluid, and fast... Android TV is Android, optimized for the living room consumption experience on a TV screen.\" That report claimed Android TV  software running on set-top boxes and TV sets  will focus on apps, games, TV shows, films and music. Expect YouTube to figure prominently too, of course. Vevo, Netflix, Hulu, Songza and Pandora have all been tipped to be available from launch on Android TV. More recently, the Wall Street Journal claimed that Google is working with several manufacturing partners on Android TV, with at least one device  likely a set-top box  set to be unveiled at I/O. That would be a direct rival for Apple's Apple TV, Amazon's Fire TV and existing devices from the likes of Roku, then, although it will be interesting to see how Android TV will fit with what Google is doing with Chromecast: perhaps the company will explain that at I/O too. 5. Cars and Android Auto Link Google is very interested in cars, and not just the self-driving ones it's developing in its research labs. In January, the company launched its Open Automotive Alliance (OAA), pitching it as \"a group of leading automakers and technology companies that share a vision for making technology in the car safer, more seamless and more intuitive for everyone\". Or, alternatively: Google's decision to enter the race to control connected cars, going up against Apple, Microsoft and carmakers like Ford that have developed their own platforms. Here's how Google explained it in January: \"Today, millions of people already bring Android phones and tablets into their cars, but its not yet a driving-optimized experience. Wouldn't it be great if you could bring your favorite apps and music with you, and use them safely with your car's built-in controls and in-dash display? Together with our OAA partners, we're working to enable new forms of integration with Android devices, and adapting Android for the car to make driving safer, easier and more enjoyable for everyone.\" I/O should see Google talking about the next steps in its connected car strategy. Rumours suggest that it'll unveil something that's been codenamed Auto Link internally: the equivalent for cars to Android Wear for wearables (or, indeed, a direct rival to Apple's CarPlay software). That'll be the first of the \"new forms of integration\" referred to above, although it's more doubtful whether we'll see any specific cars announced that will use Auto Link  those unveilings may come at one of the major motor shows later in the year. But what else? Google has many fingers in many pies, so its I/O keynote could also showcase any number of new products and announcements. For example, the company may talk more about its plans to put Google Glass on general sale in the US, as well as its rollout to international countries beyond the UK, where it launched this week. Google might get its Nest subsidiary on-stage to talk about home automation, its $555m acquisition of connected camera company Dropcam, and its vision for the internet of things. We may get updates on research projects like modular smartphone Project Ara and location-aware phone Project Tango, and perhaps something on floaty internet-beaming initiative Project Loon. There has been speculation about the lack of sessions focused on the Google+ social platform during the rest of I/O  it's extremely unlikely to be killed off during the keynote, but we'll be watching closely to gauge how it fits into Google's priorities, following the departure earlier in the year of its driving force, Vic Gundotra. What about new hardware? While there have been rumours of a new 8.9in Android tablet in Google's Nexus range (allegedly made by HTC), that may be held for later in the year. It seems if there will be new devices, they'll more likely be shown off by partners. Finally, there may well be a carefully-staged Big Moment during the keynote. The one to beat is 2012, when Glass-wearing skydivers landed on the building housing the I/O conference, then hopped onto mountain bikes to pedal into the venue. The Guardian will have full coverage of the announcements (and Big Moments) of I/O 2014 this evening.", "label": {"what": ["Google's annual developer conference Google I/O begins on Wednesday evening UK time", "expectations are high for a new version of Android, a fresh assault on TV, and a focus on wearables and fitness", "introduce the new technology and services that the company has been working on", "It's earlier than expected based on previous versions - possibly to give handset makers time to incorporate it into new devices for Christmas sales", "That report claimed Android TV software running on set-top boxes and TV sets will focus on apps, games, TV shows, films and music.

{"text": "Google has begun deleting some search results at the request of its users, following a court ruling that European Union citizens have a right to ask for the removal of embarrassing personal information that pops up on a search of their names. Several weeks after the May ruling by the European Court of Justice on the so-called \"right to be forgotten,\" the company set up an online interface for users to register their complaints. The company said Thursday it has begun taking down results this week. But Google's European spokesman Al Verney said there is a significant backlog to work through. At last report, more than 50,000 people from multiple nationalities had filed requests to have information removed. \"Each request has to be assessed individually,\" Verney said. The company is not releasing information on what percentage of complaints appear to fall into areas the court specified as potentially objectionable: results that are \"inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant.\" Europe's national data protection agencies have said they expect a mixed bag of 'legitimate' complaints, as well as some that are clearly not and some borderline cases. Critics of the ruling say removing result links is censorship, and will lead to politicians and criminals requesting elimination of information. But supporters note the court specified Google should not remove links to information when the public's right to know about it outweighs an individual's right to privacy. Under the system Google has set up, any search on a user's name from within the European Union is supposed to show a warning that information may have been removed due to privacy considerations, though the system is not yet fully operational. In cases where the company decides to reject a response to scrub results, it informs the person that complained of its decision. Then it tells them how to contact their national data protection agency if they disagree with the decision and want to pursue the matter further. Google is only deleting information that appears on its own results pages. It has no control over information on external websites, which did not fall under the court's ruling.", "label": {"what": ["Google has begun deleting some search results at the request of its users, following a court ruling that European Union citizens have a right to ask for the removal of embarrassing personal information that pops up on a search of their names", "Europe's national data protection agencies have said they expect a mixed bag of legitimate complaints, as well as some that are clearly not and some borderline cases"], "when": ["Several weeks after the May", "Thursday"], "where": ["the European Court of Justice", "the court", "within the European Union"], "why": ["following a court ruling that European Union citizens have a right to ask for the removal of embarrassing personal information that pops up on a search of their names", "how to contact their national data protection agency if they disagree with the decision and want to pursue the matter further"], "who": ["Google's European spokesman Al Verney", "more than 50,000 people from multiple nationalities", "Google's European spokesman Al Verney"], "how": ["the company set up an online interface for users to register their complaints", "lead to politicians and criminals requesting elimination of information"], "charges": ["supporters note the court specified Google should not remove links to information when the public's right to know about it outweighs an individual's right to privacy", "Critics of the ruling say removing result links is censorship, and will lead to politicians and criminals requesting elimination of information"], "plead": ["Google is only deleting information that appears on its own results pages.

{"text": "Shortly after Googles keynote presentation at the companys developer conference on Wednesday, I was ushered into a green room backstage at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. As workers broke down the huge conference stage around us  with the lights flickering on and off, somewhat apocalyptically  I spent a half hour talking to Larry Page, Googles chief executive, and Sundar Pichai, Googles senior vice president in charge of Android and Chrome. Sergey Brin, who founded Google with Mr. Page, popped in and out of the room but did not take part in the interview. We chatted about Googles efforts to usher in the multidevice future of computing, and the challenges it may face in that task. We also discussed how Googles ambitions might alter its image. I wrote a column about some of our discussion, but Mr. Page and Mr. Pichai made other comments that are also worth airing. Here is a fuller, though edited transcript of the discussion: Q.\n\nOne of the themes here is that Android is going to be a platform for more than phones  you want to have it in multiple devices. Whats the long-term vision for how Google services will be in different devices? A.\n\nMr. Page: Thats a very broad question. Weve been talking about a multiscreen world for a long time. I think you see it culminating in something thats a great experience across lots of different kinds of devices, from the watch to the TV to the laptop to the tablet to the phone. But I think theres much more to do. I think its exciting to see developers  if were reasonably clever and thoughtful about what we do, we can get experiences that make sense to users and are reasonably easy for developers to implement. Q.\n\nHow useful is the multiscreen world now? A.\n\nMr. Page: More and more of my time is on phones  though also its nice to use a big screen and have something plugged in. Some of the basic things weve done like Chrome tab synchronization and the ability to access your email across devices, we take those things for granted, but if you use them 100 times a day its a really important thing. Mr. Pichai: I also think we are just at the beginning stages. Today, computing mainly automates things for you. But theres an evolution from, today we tell computers to do stuff for us, to where computers can actually do stuff for us. For example, if I go and pick up my kids, it would be good for my car to be aware that my kids have entered the car and change the music to something thats appropriate for them. Q.\n\nWhat are the hurdles in that path? A.\n\nMr. Page: Like anything, its just work. Its easier to talk about things than do them. Q.\n\nDo you worry that the more devices we have that are connected to Google, theres not just a privacy question but also something like creepiness? A.\n\nMr. Page: I think that the Internet and mobile devices in general is changing peoples lives a lot. And were feeling that. Everyone can tell that their lives are going to be affected, but we dont quite know how yet, because were not using these things  and because of that theres a lot of uncertainty. I think well figure that out and well get products, services and technologies that really benefit people a lot, and that make their lives significantly better. And as we do that people will understand those  and then therell be the next set of things. Q.\n\nYoure saying the usefulness of the products will change how people feel about them? A.\n\nMr. Page: Yeah, and we know that if we talk about things before people see them, theres a much more negative reaction. Thats one of the things we learned. Its really important for people to be able to experience products; otherwise you fear the worst without seeing those benefits. Im not trying to minimize the issues. For me, Im so excited about the possibilities to improve things for people, my worry would be the opposite. We get so worried about these things that we dont get the benefits. I think thats whats happened in health care. Weve decided, through regulation largely, that data is so locked up that it cant be used to benefit people very well. Right now we dont data-mine health care data. If we did wed probably save 100,000 lives next year. Im very worried that the media and governments will try to stoke the peoples fears and well end up in a state where we could benefit a lot of people but were not able to do that. Thats the likely outcome. Q.\n\nWhat can you do about that? A.\n\nMr. Page: I think talking about it  being honest that these things are going to change peoples lives, these are major issues we should be talking about. But not trying to sensationalize it and figuring out how to have a good dialogue about the issues that are out there. I would encourage people to have an open mind, and to look to the future with a sense of optimism. Q.\n\nYou bought Nest and Dropcam recently. But you also sold Motorola. What are your thoughts on Googles approach to building hardware? A.\n\nMr. Pichai: When Larry and Sergey founded Google Search, one of the things that struck me is that it was available for everyone to use. We deeply desire our services to work for everyone. And that inherently means we have to work with partners. That is the thesis underlying everything we do. Mr. Page: Thats why our services work on iOS. Mr. Pichai: We do hardware when we think we need to guide the industry, which is why we do things like Nexus. Philosophically were deeply committed to working on an ecosystem at scale. Q.\n\nSo where do Nest and Dropcam fit in? A.\n\nMr. Page: Nest has a very strong team. Ive had home control stuff since 10 years ago. I was installing various things and it never quite worked. Its a nascent market. I think Nest is able to lead that ecosystem. At the early stages, thats what you see. Mr. Pichai: Nest is one vertical implementation of a set of smart products for the home. But we will support other peoples smart products for the home. Q.\n\nWas there some part of the Nest acquisition that was aimed at improving Google hardware generally  theyre good at hardware, and you need that expertise for other Google hardware? A.\n\nMr. Page: A lot has been written about that, but I dont think thats the primary motivation. It was a pretty expensive company. They have a lot of product traction, which seemed important to us. The idea that we want to distract them from that doesnt make a lot of sense. What we got with Nest was a complete, functioning company and brand in an important, emerging area, thats doing really well. Q.\n\nWhats going on with Google Plus? A.\n\nMr. Page: I think theres a lot of things going on with Google Plus. Im a very excited user of it. You saw some demos showing how it works with Chromecast  thats one of the things Ive been excited about. The service has been growing tremendously. People are always like, Oh, whats going on? But for us, were superexcited about it because its a big service, growing continuously, since we launched it, at a high rate, and were making it better and better every day. Q.\n\nIs social as important to you now as it was two years ago? A.\n\nMr. Page: Yes, if anything, probably more important. We have a very excited, dedicated community. People forget were able to make our services better by understanding your relationships, making sharing work and understanding identity. These are deep and important things for us as a company. When people ask about Google Plus they think about it as, Im going to the stream. For us, Google Play reviews are part of Google Plus, too. We see all those things growing and being important for us. Q.\n\nI wanted to ask about the European right-to-forget ruling. What was your reaction to that? A.\n\nMr. Page:  Right to be forgotten. You cant forget, but you can be forgotten. I think in general the issues about how you might be represented online when people search for you is an important issue. To date, weve said well try our best to represent the things that are out there on the Internet about you. Its worked for 15-plus years. It makes a lot of sense. Were a search engine. It seems like we should represent whats in the world. So it was a pretty surprising ruling  its a different statement. You guys are now in charge of editing whats out there in the world. In the past thats not a responsibility we felt we had. I think given thats the ruling, weve obviously said were going to start complying with that. Were going to start removing some stuff pretty quickly  I think in the next week. Were obviously going to try to do the best job we can. I think it would have been better to have more of a discussion about what to do and how to do it. We could have arrived at a more practical place than a court ruling. The previous system, where content is removed at the source of publishing, means that once its removed there, its removed for all other services. Whereas with the ruling, it has to be removed from all services  so if youre an aggrieved user, you have to get your information removed from many sites that have that data. That doesnt seem very practical. Q.\n\nI want to return again to this idea of Googles image. There were a couple of protests here. There have been protests about Google buses. A.\n\nMr. Page: Were in San Francisco, so we expect that. Q.\n\nDo you think its just that? One of the things thats happening in the world is that people are worried about technology and how its changing our lives  is this a manifestation of that worry? A.\n\nMr. Page: Im sure that people are worried about that. Im sure thats contributing to it. But I do think there are serious issues in San Francisco. Theres a rich history of protest in San Francisco. I think some of the issues  we have complaints about some things that are not that related to the company. To some extent were being used as a way to attract attention. We had protests about the C.I.A. and I dont know what else, but it didnt make any sense to me with respect to the company. As a big company were a target for some of these things. But I think people have legitimate issues with it as well. Mr. Pichai: Were doing a lot about it as well. There are a host of initiatives for the city. I think in some ways its good that theres an open debate about it and I think we needed it.

{"text": "Put a couple of thousand developers from around the world in a huge hall, show them some under the bonnet improvements in the software tools they use every day, and pause after each sentence to bathe in the applause. That's the basic recipe for Google I/O which is aimed at the development community, not at consumers. But Google knows that these days the world is watching too - so it has to sprinkle the conference's opening keynote with a little stardust in the form of some stunts and a few product announcements. Two years ago a live demo with skydivers jumping out of planes and streaming video from Google Glass set the bar very high indeed. This year there was nothing quite to match that - indeed when a couple of the presentations in a three-hour marathon session were interrupted by protesters I suspected they might have been planted by Google to wake us up. But between the live cloud debugging demo that went a bit wrong and a lengthy look at a concept called \"material design\" in the new version of Android, we got a powerful statement of Google's ambitions. This is a company that sees its services becoming vital to every area of our lives, and its principal weapon is its increasingly dominant mobile operating system. Android, already on a billion devices, is going to be everywhere - on your wrist, on your TV, in your car. We were shown Android Wear powering a new range of smartwatches which will know where you are and deliver all sorts of useful information of the kind that Google Now puts on your smartphone. You'll be reminded that your flight leaves soon, get your boarding pass and a weather forecast, see a read-out of your heart rate after a jog, all on your wrist rather than reaching into your pocket. \"RIP Fitbit\" read one tweet during the demo. Android TV will power a new generation of connected televisions from major manufacturers, allowing you to search for content by talking to your phone, which becomes the remote control. The presenter said \"Oscar nominated movies 2002\" and up popped all those films on the screen with options to view them. \"Users don't want or expect complexity from their TV,\" we were told, so perhaps Google has learned a lesson. This is not its first venture into connected television - Google TV which involved far too much leaning forward and typing never took off in what is a lean-back activity. And then we were shown Android Auto, which will deliver information via smartphone to drivers. Again, it depends on voice commands. Tell it to find a route somewhere and Google Maps will do the trick without all that cumbersome tapping on a satnav, ask it to play music and it riffles through your albums. By Christmas, some new models will have this feature built in, but for now the connected car looks like more of a niche interest than some of Google's other projects. And in all of these areas Google is going head to head with Apple. Tim Cook has promised a new product category this year, and all the indications are that it will be the iWatch. Apple has already announced Car Play, designed to use its iOS operating system to deliver a similar service to Android Auto. And Apple TV got a big boost this week, signing content deals with America's ABC News and AOL, though it remains quite a limited device. These two giants with ambitions to run our lives have very different approaches. Google sees its job as providing a template through these various flavours of Android and then letting developers and product designers get on with it, with very little interference. Apple has always been far more controlling and secretive, intent on mastery over every detail of hardware and software before a product is released. That means that Android is ahead of the game in areas like wearables, where big names like Samsung and LG are already churning out devices. The problem is that many of the early products have proved distinctly underwhelming, and if Apple does produce a beautiful and compelling smart watch, Android rivals will have to cut their margins to compete. One key factor in this battle will be the army of developers who make Android and iOS such powerful platforms. Android is now a much bigger player in the market, but the analyst Benedict Evans tweets today that \"Google and Apple numbers show Android app ARPU (average revenue per user) is a quarter of iOS.\" In other words, it's much harder making money from Android apps, although that doesn't stop developers rushing to spend $900 to come to the I/O conference. Mind you, Apple's equivalent event WWDC costs $1599 to attend and competition for tickets is just as intense. Now, though, an army of Android developers have been told there are all sorts of new opportunities for them. They know that in Google they have a hugely wealthy general willing to spend what it takes to make sure its infrastructure is everywhere that consumers spend their time.", "label": {"what": ["You'll be reminded that your flight leaves soon, get your boarding pass and a weather forecast, see a read-out of your heart rate after a jog, all on your wrist rather than reaching into your pocket", "some new models will have this feature built in, but for now the connected car looks like more of a niche interest than some of Google's other projects"], "when": ["Two years ago", "This year", "every day", "these days", "three-hour", "soon", "during the demo", "2002", "today", "this week", "Now"], "where": ["from around the world", "in a huge hall", "By Christmas", "in the software tools", "from Google Glass", "in the new version of Android", "major manufacturers", "on the screen", "in all of these areas", "in the market", "everywhere", "on your smartphone", "on your wrist, on your TV, in your car"], "why": ["This is a company that sees its services becoming vital to every area of our lives, and its principal weapon is its increasingly dominant mobile operating system", "One key factor in this battle will be the army of developers who make Android and iOS such powerful platforms"], "who": ["a couple of thousand developers", "some new models", "And in all of these areas Google is going head to head with Apple", "Apple", "Samsung and LG", "Google I/O", "Google", "protesters", "a company", "Android", "The presenter", "Oscar nominated movies 2002", "Users", "Tim Cook", "America's ABC News and AOL", "Samsung and LG", "the analyst Benedict Evans", "an army of Android developers"], "how": ["And then we were shown Android Auto, which will deliver information via smartphone to drivers", "it depends on voice commands", "Google sees its job as providing a template through these various flavours of Android and then letting developers and product designers get on with it, with very little interference"], "product_name": ["Google I/O", "Google TV", "iWatch", "iOS operating system"], "countermeasures": ["aimed at the development community, not at consumers", "We were shown Android Wear powering a new range of smartwatches which will know where you are and deliver all sorts of useful information of the kind that Google Now puts on your smartphone", "Apple has always been far more controlling and secretive, intent on mastery over every detail of hardware and software before a product is released"], "new_features": ["Android TV will power a new generation of connected televisions from major manufacturers, allowing you to search for content by talking to your phone, which becomes the remote control", "far more controlling and secretive", "intent on mastery over every detail of hardware and software before a product is released"], "effects": ["Tell it to find a route somewhere and Google Maps will do the trick without all that cumbersome tapping on a satnav, ask it to play music and it riffles through your albums", "Google sees its job as providing a template through these various flavours of Android and then letting developers and product designers get on with it, with very little interference"]}}
{"text": "Facebook paid $2 billion to get into the virtual reality business. Google managed it with a couple magnets and some cardboard. Google revealed a number of big updates to its Android software at its annual developer conference on Wednesday, but the project that generated the most smiles among those in attendance was a set of cardboard goggles that work with Android phones to create a basic virtual reality experience. Virtual reality has been a hot topic in the tech world in recent months since Facebook paid $2 billion to acquire VR firm Oculus. The \"Cardboard\" project, Google says, grew out of a desire \"to make VR accessible to more people.\" All those in attendance Wednesday received a set of the Cardboard goggles, which were designed by a pair of Googlers in Paris in their \"20% time,\" the company's term for the time it allots employees to work on their own projects. The contraption folds into place to create a viewfinder and a slot to insert a smartphone. Fire up the Cardboard Android app and you're ready for action. The goggles stay together thanks to a few velcro straps, while the phone is secured with a rubber band. A pair of lenses are mounted within the cardboard to make the field of view more immersive. Once you've got Cardboard up and running, you navigate through the app using a magnet slider on the side that gets picked up by the phone's magnetometer. You can watch videos on YouTube, float through space via Google Earth and do some virtual traveling with Google Street View. Google is opening up the software to developers, so more functions could soon be on the way. Turning your head up and down and left to right changes your view, while taking the device off your face and rotating it 90 degrees takes you back to the home screen. Google says the device works with most \"modern\" Android phones, but cautions that it's still in the development stage. It's sharing the Cardboard toolkit with developers to give them \"the chance to experiment with it as we do.\" In the meantime, Google has also put the design files online so you can try your hand at building your own.

{"text": "The world of connected devices is growing every day, and Google wants to be the company to guide you through it. That's the takeaway from the search giant's annual I/O developer conference, which wrapped up on Thursday in San Francisco. The gathering was a showcase for versions of the company's Android software adapted for cars, televisions and wearable tech. Nothing Google unveiled this week qualifies as groundbreaking (except perhaps for its cardboard virtual-reality goggles). The smartwatch- and car-focused software essentially save you the trouble of taking your smartphone out of your pocket, while Android TV doesn't appear much different than existing platforms from Apple, Roku and Amazon. But what was noteworthy about the announcements this week is the scale of Google's ambition. Google essentially wants to unify the user experience across all connected devices. That means allowing you to respond to text messages via your watch, order pizza from your TV, control your home from your car, and accomplish it all via a common voice-command interface that remembers your appointments and preferences. Speaking during a breakout session at the conference, Android TV manager Chris McKillop encouraged developers to think of the project not as a distinct platform, but simply \"a new form factor for Android\" -- just one part of a broader constellation of Android-powered devices. It's a shrewd strategy. As Internet-enabled products become more commonplace, we're not going to want to manage a huge variety of accounts. It's more convenient to have a common digital identity that moves with you across devices. The company that provides that single software identify is poised to reap massive rewards. Google made what seemed like an admission of defeat earlier this year when it announced that it was selling its Motorola Mobility smartphone unit to Lenovo for for $2.9 billion, after acquiring the business for $12.5 billion in May 2012. But with its \"Android everywhere\" strategy, it doesn't need to make devices itself; it's better off working with as many hardware manufacturers as possible to ensure that its software is ubiquitous. Apple's vision for its iOS software is similarly ambitious -- the company already has a success with Apple TV, it announced plans for health- and home-focused software earlier this month, and it's reportedly working on its own smartwatch. But Google's greater willingness to partner with hardware makers may give Android the advantage in the emerging connected device market. That dynamic has already played out in the smartphone and tablet markets, where Android now dominates because Google hasn't forced phone buyers to stick with one line of devices the way Apple does with the iPhone. Samsung and LG released smartwatches this week running Android Wear, with one due out from Motorola later this year. Android TV-enabled products are pending from companies including Sharp, Sony and Asus, and over 40 automakers have signed on to carry Android Auto. Google is also well-positioned to be the primary entry point to the world of connected devices, given the wealth of data it already has on people who uses free services like Gmail and Google Docs. Data collection is the name of the game for the company, whether it's in the home (see its $3.2 billion purchase earlier this year of smart appliance maker Nest Labs) or in outer space (this month's $500 million acquisition of satellite start-up Skybox Imaging). The more data it collects, the more fully it can adapt its software to individual users' needs. Of course, whether you want to give a single company the power to track your sleep, monitor your communications, recommend TV shows, track your location and and access your finances is another question. But if you do, Google's ready for the job.", "label": {"what": ["The world of connected devices is growing every day, and Google wants to be the company to guide you through it", "The gathering was a showcase for versions of the company's Android software adapted for cars, televisions and wearable tech", "Nothing Google unveiled this week qualifies as groundbreaking", "the scale of Google's ambition", "encouraged developers to think of the project not as a distinct platform, but simply 'a new form factor for Android'", "we're not going to want to manage a huge variety of accounts", "Google made what seemed like an admission of defeat earlier this year when it announced that it was selling its Motorola Mobility smartphone unit to Lenovo for for $2.9 billion", "Apple's vision for its iOS software is similarly ambitious -- the company already has a success with Apple TV, it announced plans for health- and home-focused software", "Google's greater willingness to partner with hardware makers", "That dynamic has already played out in the smartphone and tablet markets, where Android now dominates", "Samsung and LG released smartwatches this week", "one due out from Motorola", "Android TV-enabled products are pending from companies including Sharp, Sony and Asus", "Google is also well-positioned to be the primary entry point to the world of connected devices", "Google's ready for the job"], "when": ["every day", "on Thursday", "this week", "earlier this year", "in May 2012", "earlier this month", "later this year", "this month"], "where": ["from the search giant's annual I/O developer conference", "in San Francisco", "at the conference", "in the home", "in outer space"], "why": ["Google essentially wants to unify the user experience across all connected devices", "Internet-enabled products become more commonplace", "provides that single software identify", "its 'Android everywhere' strategy", "Google hasn't forced phone buyers to stick with one line of devices the way Apple does with the iPhone", "the wealth of data it already has on people who uses free services like Gmail and Google Docs"], "who": ["Google", "Android TV manager Chris McKillop", "Samsung", "LG", "Motorola", "its $3.2 billion purchase earlier this year of smart appliance maker Nest Labs", "$500 million acquisition of satellite start-up Skybox Imaging"], "how": ["except perhaps for its cardboard virtual-reality goggles", "The smartwatch- and car-focused software essentially save you the trouble of taking your smartphone out of your pocket", "Android TV doesn't appear much different than existing platforms from Apple, Roku and Amazon", "was noteworthy about the announcements this week", "allowing you to respond to text messages via your watch, order pizza from your TV, control your home from your car, and accomplish it all via a common voice-command interface that remembers your appointments and preferences", "Speaking during a breakout session", "just one part of a broader constellation of Android-powered devices", "a shrewd strategy", "It's more convenient to have a common digital identity that moves with you across devices", "is poised to reap massive rewards", "after acquiring the business for $12.5 billion", "it doesn't need to make devices itself; it's better off working with as many hardware manufacturers as possible to ensure that its software is ubiquitous", "it's reportedly working on its own smartwatch", "may give Android the advantage in the emerging connected device market", "running Android Wear", "over 40 automakers have signed on to carry Android Auto", "Data collection is the name of the game for the company", "The more data it collects, the more fully it can adapt its software to individual users' needs", "to give a single company the power to track your sleep, monitor your communications, recommend TV shows, track your location and and access your finances"]}}

Three cars derailed in the tunnel after a power surge triggered an alarm, which caused the train to stop abruptly. Russian television described scenes of chaos and panic on the capital city's famed system, saying passengers fell like dominoes when the train braked. Russia's investigative committee said it was looking into the causes of the accident. It said, however, there was no suspicion of a militant attack, the cause for scores of deaths in Moscow's underground in years past. Injured passengers were carried on stretchers, bloodied and bandaged, out of metro stations and helicopters ferried the most seriously hurt to hospital. Passengers looked stunned or were crying after being helped to the surface by emergency services. Evacuation underway The evacuation of people trapped underground was still under way, said deputy head of Moscow metro police Nikolai Savchenko. Our task at the moment is to complete evacuation of those suffered (in accident), to calm down passengers which are still near the station, Savchenko said. More than 100 people had been hospitalized, and at least 50 of the injured are in grave condition, said Moscow health department chief Georgy Golukhov, according to the Itar-TASS news agency. Rescuers have recovered seven bodies and are working to extract 12 more trapped in two wrecked train cars, Alexander Gavrilov, deputy chief of the Moscow emergency services, told reporters in a televised call. Gavrilov, of the emergency situations ministry, said outside the Park Pobedy station in west Moscow that more than 1,100 people were evacuated from the train. Passengers said that smoke quickly spread through the carriages and rescue workers treated them with oxygen. A city transport services spokesman told news agency Interfax that all passengers had been evacuated from the affected stations by midday, dismissing reports that some passengers were still trapped in the underground tunnel. President Vladimir Putin, who is currently on a trip to Brazil, was informed of the tragedy that put a huge strain on the city of some 12 million and snarled traffic on its notoriously clogged roads amid a heatwave, the French news agency AFP reported. The Moscow metro is the world's busiest, with as many as 9 million people on weekdays riding a system that is widely recognized for its reliability.\nThe subway cars derailed between the Slaviansky Boulevard and Park Pobedy stations. Difficult rescue Park Pobedy is the deepest metro station in Moscow's subway system - 84 meters (275 feet) deep - which made the rescue particularly hard. Traffic on between the stations is likely to be suspended for at least two days, Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said. The station serves the vast Park Pobedy, where the World War II museum is located and which is close to Moscow's triumphal arch. Famed for its high-vaulted halls adorned with Soviet socialist realist art, the underground network has expanded from 13 stations opened in 1935 to 194 stations across the megalopolis today. Islamist militants have previously carried out deadly attacks in Moscow, including twin suicide bombings that killed 40 people on the subway in 2010.

President Vladimir Putin, who is away in Brazil, ordered a criminal investigation into the accident, which is likely to raise further questions over Russia's transport safety record. There was no suspicion of a militant attack - the cause of scores of deaths in Moscow's subway system in years past. Three carriages derailed on a train travelling between two stations at 70 km per hour (44 miles per hour) at around 8:35 a.m. (0435 GMT) on the world's busiest subway system. \"It braked very hard.

The Investigative Committee put the toll at 20 dead. Russian news agency Itar-Tass quoted Health Ministry representative Oleg Salagai as saying that 129 people were injured, 42 of whom were in a serious condition. NO SUSPICION OF MILITANT ATTACK The Investigative Committee, which answers to Putin, said it had opened a criminal case on suspicion of failure to meet safety guidelines but that it had not yet determined the cause of the accident, although no militant involvement was suspected. A power surge may have caused the train to stall and several cars to come off the rails between the Slaviansky Boulevard and Park Pobedy stations, the Investigative Committee said. Russians regularly criticise the country's transport safety record. Recent disasters included the 2011 sinking of a ferry boat that killed 128 and an airplane crash that killed the Lokomotiv Yaroslavl ice hockey team the same year, both of which were blamed on lax safety regulations and technical errors.

{"text": "A train derailment deep underground in the Moscow metro caused at least 20 deaths and 150 injuries during Tuesday morning's rush hour. The accident occurred just after 9am in the west of the city between Park Pobedy and Slavyansky Bulvar stations, one of the deepest points in the Moscow metro system. Initial reports suggest a fire alarm system was automatically triggered in error, leading to the driver braking suddenly and one of the carriages coming off the tracks. Later, however, a spokesman for Russian investigators said they were focusing on possible faults in the train cars or subsidence under the rails as possible causes. Terrorism was ruled out. Witnesses reported that panic took hold as people were thrown around inside the carriages. The driver of the train was among the dead. The Russian website LifeNews posted a video interview with a man who had been on the derailed train: \"I got into the train, 20 seconds went by, then the lights went out and everything shook. I was thrown into the middle of the carriage. Panic broke out. Some men took the emergency hammers and smashed their way out. We were accompanied through the tunnel by construction workers. Some of the train was really smashed up, you could see a lot of people were crushed in.\" Andrei Petrov, a passenger in the metro train behind the derailed train, said even in his carriage there were some injuries as the train braked suddenly. \"There was no panic, everyone waited in the carriage and waited for what the driver would say. But there was some injuries and blood, and one person broke a rib, I think,\" he told TV Rain. Four hours after the incident deputy mayor Petr Biryukov said there were still seven passengers trapped inside one of the carriages underground, and rescuers were attempting to cut through metal in order to reach them. Rescuers worked throughout the day to free bodies from the wreckage. Carriages appeared to have come off the rails completely and turned on their side. Health officials said at least 106 people were hospitalised, with around half of them in serious condition. Fire engines, ambulances and helicopters could be seen around the exits to the two stations, and several major roads were closed for the day to allow emergency vehicles to move unhindered. The Moscow mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, said there would be a full investigation to determine whether there was any criminal responsibility for the incident. \"We will get to the bottom of this situation and the guilty will be punished very harshly,\" he told Kommersant FM radio station. He added that families of those who died in the tragedy would be paid 1 million roubles (17,000), while the injured would receive half that. The Moscow metro is one of the most efficient in the world, with trains running frequently and rarely stopping for signals. A journey costs 40 roubles (75p) in peak times when the trains are always rammed with commuters. It is usually the easiest and safest way to get around Moscow, although the system has been targeted by Chechen terrorists before, most recently in 2010 when twin female suicide bombers killed more than 40 people in two separate attacks. Russian authorities said there was no sign that Tuesday's incident was anything other than an accident.

Of the 136 people hospitalized, at least 42 were in grave condition Tuesday evening, health officials said. By late afternoon, rescuers had recovered seven bodies and were working to extract 12 more trapped in two wrecked train cars at the Park Pobedy station, said Alexander Gavrilov, deputy chief of Moscow's emergency services. One woman taken from the scene died at a Moscow hospital. One citizen of China and one citizen of Tajikistan were among those killed, Russian news agencies quoted city officials as saying. Over 1,100 people were evacuated from the train, which was stuck between two stations, in a rescue operation that ended more than 12 hours after the accident. In video released by the Emergency Situations Ministry, several wrecked train cars looked almost coiled, occupying the entire width of the tunnel. Workers were trying to force open the mangled doors of one car to retrieve bodies. Photos posted on social media sites showed passengers walking along the tracks in the dimly lit tunnel. Paramedics carried one woman covered with a blanket to the lawn by the famous Triumphal Arch and put her on a medical helicopter, one of four seen taking off from the park. In the scorching summer weather authorities provided drinking water to survivors, some of whom were sitting near the station's entrance in a state of a shock. Several cars left the track after a power surge triggered an emergency alarm, which caused the train to come to an abrupt stop in the western part of the Russian capital. Mayor Sergei Sobyanin told reporters that unnamed officials will not only be fired but also charged with crimes, though he would not say what charges they might face. Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev offered his condolences for the victims and their families. Moscow's transit system has been previously targeted by terrorists but this time Russian officials have vehemently dismissed terrorism as a possible cause.

Another 160 people are injured, of whom more than 120 were hospitalized, the Moscow health care department said. Of those, a few dozen were in critical condition. The derailment took place during morning rush hour in the Russian capital. Three metro train cars derailed in a tunnel, the state-run ITAR-Tass news agency reported. More than 200 people were evacuated, the Emergency Ministry said on its website. Dozens of ambulances arrived at the scene, along with three helicopters, to help shuttle the injured to hospitals, ITAR-Tass said. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin declared Wednesday as a day of mourning. The cause is under investigation It was not clear what caused the derailment, but the head of Moscow's Transportation Department said it was not a terrorist attack. However, it's still subject to a criminal investigation as authorities seek to find out what's behind the crash. In the moments afterward, many of those caught up in the derailment scrambled back up to the surface at the station west of central Moscow, some bleeding and dazed as they emerged.

{"text": "Malaysia's leader has called the Malaysia Airlines plane crash in eastern Ukraine \"deeply shocking\". Describing the disaster as a \"tragic day\" in a \"tragic year\" for Malaysia, Najib Razak said the investigation \"must not be hindered in any way\". The plane, carrying 298 people, crashed in rebel-held territory near the Russian border. Both sides in Ukraine's civil conflict have accused the other of shooting it down with a missile. The Boeing 777, with the call sign MH17, was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. It is the second disaster suffered by Malaysia Airlines this year. Flight MH370 disappeared en route from Malaysia to China in March and has still not been found. In a statement, Malaysia Airlines said MH17 was carrying at least 154 Dutch nationals, 27 Australians, 43 Malaysians (including 15 crew), 12 Indonesians and nine Britons. Other passengers came from Germany, Belgium, the Philippines and Canada, with the nationalities of 41 people not yet confirmed. Several of those on board - it is not yet clear how many - were heading for a major international conference on HIV/Aids in Melbourne, Australian officials said. Other airlines have announced they are now setting flight paths to avoid eastern Ukraine, while Ukraine authorities have declared the area a no-fly zone, according to European flight safety body Eurocontrol. Multiple reports from Washington cite unnamed US officials as saying they believe the plane, which had reportedly been flying at more than 30,000 feet (10,000m), must have been brought down by a sophisticated surface-to-air missile. The UN Security Council is to hold an emergency meeting on the disaster on Friday morning in New York. 'Swift justice' In his statement, the Malaysian leader said the plane's route had been declared safe by the International Civil Aviation Organisation. He said the plane had not made a distress call. \"Malaysia is unable to verify the cause of this tragedy. But we must - and we will - find out precisely what happened to this flight,\" Mr Najib said. \"If it transpires that the plane was indeed shot down, we insist that the perpetrators must swiftly be brought to justice.\" Malaysia is sending a team to Ukraine to help with the investigation. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said it was an \"act of terrorism\". Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin told the BBC he had intercepted phone conversations that proved the plane was shot down by pro-Russian separatists. But Russian President Vladimir Putin blamed the Ukraine government for restarting military operations in the area, where it is trying to regain control from pro-Russian rebels. \"The country in whose airspace this happened bears responsibility for it,\" he said. Separatist leader Alexander Borodai, meanwhile, accused the Ukrainian government of bringing down the airliner. In a telephone conversation, US President Barack Obama and the Dutch leader, Mark Rutte, \"agreed on the need to assure immediate access to the site... to international investigators... to carry out a thorough investigation\", the White House said. A subsequent White House statement said it was \"critical that there be a full, credible and unimpeded international investigation as quickly as possible\". 'Mistake or terrorism' The plane fell between Krasni Luch in Luhansk region and Shakhtarsk in the neighbouring region of Donetsk. The head of the Russian Air Traffic Controllers' Union, Sergei Kovalyov, told BBC Russian that the airspace over eastern Ukraine had remained open during the conflict because the planes previously shot down had tended to be helicopters or low-flying fast jets. \"In order to bring down an airplane from an altitude of 10,000m, you need to have very serious weapons. missiles,\" he said. \"It's either a mistake or a terrorist act.\" Analysis: Jonathan Marcus, BBC News If it does turn out that the Boeing 777 was shot down by the separatists - with weaponry supplied by Moscow - then it could significantly alter the terms of the whole debate surrounding the Ukraine crisis. Over the past few days there has been growing concern among Western governments that Russia was stepping up its military support for the separatists in eastern Ukraine. Nato spokesmen insist that more and more heavy military equipment has moved from Russian stockpiles to the separatists across the border. In response, the United States has strengthened its economic sanctions against Moscow - it is threatening even stronger action - though the European Union has so far failed to follow Washington's lead. But if Russia in any way had a hand in this tragedy then the pressure - especially on the Europeans - for much tougher sanctions will only grow. Ukraine has accused Russia's military of supplying advanced missiles to the rebels. Earlier on Thursday, Ukrainian officials blamed the Russian air force for shooting down one of its ground attack jets on Wednesday, and a transport plane on Monday. In 2001, Ukraine admitted its military was probably responsible for shooting down a Russian airliner that crashed into the Black Sea, killing all 78 people on board.", "label": {"what": ["the Malaysia Airlines plane crash in eastern Ukraine", "The plane, carrying 298 people, crashed in rebel-held territory near the Russian border", "The Boeing 777, with the call sign MH17, was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur", "It is the second disaster suffered by Malaysia Airlines this year", "Flight MH370 disappeared en route from Malaysia to China in March and has still not been found", "Multiple reports from Washington cite unnamed US officials", "flying at more than 30,000 feet (10,000m)", "the plane's route had been declared safe by the International Civil Aviation Organisation", "the plane had not made a distress call", "Malaysia is unable to verify the cause of this tragedy", "he had intercepted phone conversations", "Russian President Vladimir Putin blamed the Ukraine government", "accused the Ukrainian government of bringing down the airliner", "The plane fell between Krasni Luch in Luhansk region and Shakhtarsk in the neighbouring region of Donetsk", "there has been growing concern among Western governments", "more and more heavy military equipment has moved from Russian stockpiles to the separatists", "Ukraine has accused Russia's military of supplying advanced missiles to the rebels"], "when": ["in a 'tragic year'", "this year", "in March", "on Friday morning", "during the conflict", "Over the past few days", "Earlier on Thursday", "on Wednesday", "on Monday", "In 2001"], "where": ["in eastern Ukraine", "near the Russian border", "Amsterdam", "Kuala Lumpur", "Malaysia", "China", "In a statement", "Germany", "Belgium", "the Philippines", "Canada", "in Melbourne", "a no-fly zone", "in New York", "In a telephone conversation", "in Luhansk region", "in the neighbouring region of Donetsk", "across the border"], "why": ["for a major international conference on HIV/Aids in Melbourne", "the airspace over eastern Ukraine had remained open", "for restarting military operations in the area", "because the planes previously shot down had tended to be helicopters or low-flying fast jets", "for shooting down one of its ground attack jets"], "who": ["Both sides in Ukraine's civil conflict", "Malaysia's leader", "Najib Razak", "298 people", "Both sides in Ukraine's civil conflict", "Malaysia Airlines", "at least 154 Dutch nationals", "27 Australians", "43 Malaysians", "15 crew", "12 Indonesians", "nine Britons", "41 people", "Australian officials", "Ukraine authorities", "European flight safety body Eurocontrol", "unnamed US officials", "The UN Security Council", "Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko", "Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin", "US President Barack Obama", "Dutch leader, Mark Rutte", "international investigators", "the White House", "The head of the Russian Air Traffic Controllers' Union, Sergei Kovalyov", "BBC Russian", "Jonathan Marcus", "among Western governments", "Nato spokesmen", "the European Union"], "how": ["shooting it down with a missile", "by a sophisticated surface-to-air missile", "as a 'tragic day'", "in any way", "an 'act of terrorism'", "a full, credible and unimpeded international investigation", "with weaponry supplied by Moscow"], "damages": ["The plane, carrying 298 people, crashed", "has still not been found", "crashed into the Black Sea", "killing all 78 people on board"], "countermeasures": ["the investigation", "Other airlines have announced they are now setting flight paths to avoid eastern Ukraine", "hold an emergency meeting on the disaster", "the perpetrators must swiftly be brought to justice", "sending a team to Ukraine to help with the investigation", "carry out a thorough investigation"], "perpetrators": ["pro-Russian separatists", "pro-Russian rebels", "Separatist leader Alexander Borodai", "the United States has strengthened its economic sanctions against Moscow"]}}
{"text": "The loss of a second Boeing 777 in 131 days threatens Malaysia Airlines with another public relations and financial blow as it struggles to overcome industry and consumer fallout after the disappearance of Flight 370. On Thursday, Flight 17 heading from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur crashed in eastern Ukraine, according to reports from the Russian news agency Interfax. Early speculation centered on the possibility it was shot down at an altitude of more than 30,000 feet. The company confirmed that it lost contact with the flight -- coded MH17. Its last known position was over Ukrainian airspace. The plane is said to have crashed in eastern Ukraine near the border with Russia. Russian-backed separatists are fighting the Ukrainian military in the region. As the tragedy unfolds with the obvious potential for significant wreckage and devastating loss of life, the threat to Malaysia Airlines as a company is potentially greater than any single airline disaster, said corporate turnaround expert Ted Gavin, founding partner and managing director of Gavin/Solmonese. \"This is a potentially fatal event for that airline, but also it's an event for them to redeem themselves in how they deal with information and the public,\" he said. Missing Flight 370 In the weeks following the disappearance of Flight 370, some family members of passengers were harshly critical of Malaysia Airlines and Malaysian aviation authorities regarding the investigation. Family members accused airline officials of not offering information about how they responded immediately after the plane disappeared. In the months that followed, they expressed distrust of the airline and Malaysia's government. \"The way Malaysia Airlines handled the disappearance of the last jet was a huge hit to confidence,\" said Gavin. In the immediate hours following Thursday's disaster, Gavin said \"the airline needs to share every piece of information and every piece of data they have, including the decision making process that led to that plane flying over a recent conflict region.\" It also must be unashamed to discuss possible mistakes that were made, said Gavin. \"What can't happen is week-long deliberations where families of crash victims don't hear from them or don't know anything.\" \"Frankly this is an opportunity for them to talk about what they've learned and what they've done better and what they've done differently since Flight 370.\" Searchers are apparently no closer to solving the mystery surrounding the Malaysia AIrlines flight which went missing March 8 en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 passengers and crew. This month, the airline's main shareholder was considering restructuring the operation and taking it private, the Wall Street Journal reported. The Journal used the words \"turn around\" and \"resuscitate\" to describe the strategy. Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak tweeted Thursday that Malaysia is launching an immediate investigation into the loss of Flight 17. In April, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered U.S. airlines to avoid airspace over Crimea, the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. It said the region posed the \"potential for conflicting air traffic control instructions from Ukrainian and Russian authorities\" and the \"misidentification of civil aircraft.\" It's unknown if Malaysian aviation officials issued a similar warning. The airline still faces possible lawsuits from family members that could total millions of dollars. Boeing's twin-engine 777 boasts an excellent safety record and is among the most sophisticated airliners flying today. Its capacity is between 300 and 450 passengers and a range of about 5,700 miles. \"There have been bad years for commercial aviation,\" Gavin said. \"But for one airline to lose two of the same type of airframe in such a short time span? It's potentially unprecedented for a commercial carrier in the modern aviation age.\" Financial troubles Analysts said it may take a government rescue to save the company from financial disaster. Malaysia Airlines has faced increased competition in recent years from new regional airlines. It tried to boost revenue by selling more tickets, rather than raising prices, while keeping operating costs under control. It has also canceled some longer flight routes. But the strategy never took hold, and the difficult business climate has forced the airline into the red for the past three years, leading to a loss of about $1.3 billion over that period. The Malaysian government has helped the largely unprofitable airline before, though its previous efforts seemed only to provide temporary respite.", "label": {"what": ["The loss of a second Boeing 777", "threatens Malaysia Airlines with another public relations and financial blow", "it struggles to overcome industry and consumer fallout after the disappearance of Flight 370", "Flight 17 heading from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur crashed in eastern Ukraine", "The company confirmed that it lost contact with the flight -- coded MH17", "near the border with Russia", "Missing Flight 370 In the weeks following the disappearance of Flight 370", "some family members of passengers were harshly critical of Malaysia Airlines and Malaysian aviation authorities regarding the investigation", "Family members accused airline officials", "they expressed distrust of the airline and Malaysia's government", "The way Malaysia Airlines handled the disappearance of the last jet was a huge hit to confidence", "faces possible lawsuits from family members that could total millions of dollars", "Malaysia Airlines has faced increased competition in recent years from new regional airlines", "It has also canceled some longer flight routes", "The Malaysian government has helped the largely unprofitable airline before"], "when": ["in 131 days", "On Thursday", "In the months that followed", "In the immediate hours following Thursday's disaster", "March 8", "This month", "In April", "in such a short time span", "in the modern aviation age", "in recent years", "for the past three years", "over that period"], "where": ["Amsterdam", "Kuala Lumpur", "in eastern Ukraine", "over Ukrainian airspace", "in the region", "from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing"], "why": ["not offering information about how they responded immediately after the plane disappeared", "potential for conflicting air traffic control instructions from Ukrainian and Russian authorities", "misidentification of civil aircraft"], "who": ["Malaysia Airlines", "the Russian news agency Interfax", "the Ukrainian military", "corporate turnaround expert Ted Gavin", "founding partner and managing director of Gavin/Solmonese", "Russian-backed separatists", "families of crash victims", "Searchers", "239 passengers and crew", "the airline's main shareholder", "the Wall Street Journal", "Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak", "the Federal Aviation Administration", "Boeing's twin-engine 777", "between 300 and 450 passengers"], "how": ["it was shot down", "at an altitude of more than 30,000 feet", "potentially greater than any single airline disaster", "by selling more tickets, rather than raising prices", "keeping operating costs under control"], "damages": ["significant wreckage", "devastating loss of life", "fatal event for that airline"], "countermeasures": ["share every piece of information and every piece of data they have", "the decision making process that led to that plane flying over a recent conflict region", "restructuring the operation and taking it private", "launching an immediate investigation", "ordered U.S. airlines to avoid airspace over Crimea, the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov", "take a government rescue"]}}
{"text": "We have just shot down a plane. ... A plume of smoke is visible. The biggest clue so far into who may have shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 might be what Ukrainian officials say are intercepted communications between pro-Russian rebels operating in eastern Ukraine. The recordings, translated and distributed by Ukrainian officials, begin with an alleged militant informing others that a plane has been shot down. The communication picks up later, once the alleged rebels reach the scene of the crash. Here's a segment of a conversation between an alleged pro-Russian rebel named Major and another identified as Grek, per Ukrainian authorities: Major: The plane broke into pieces in the air ... we have found the first 200 (dead). It's a civilian.\" Grek: \"How are things going there?\" M: \"Well, we are 100% sure that it was a civilian plane.\" G: \"Are there a lot of people?\" M: \"F--k! The debris was falling straight into the yards.\" M: \"Here are remnants of internal brackets, chairs, bodies.\" G: \"Are there any weapons?\" M: \"Nothing at all. Civilian belongings, medical scraps, towels, toilet paper.\" Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk on Friday blasted the \"terrorists\" he blamed for shooting down the plane a day earlier, with 298 people aboard. CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the phone call, and it is not known if the recordings were edited or when they were made. But Lt. Col. Rick Francona, a CNN military analyst, said he would not be surprised if Ukrainians were able to monitor the communications of the rebels. \"Ukrainian intelligence, they're pretty good in their own territory,\" he said Friday on CNN's \"New Day.\" In a final segment of the alleged intercepted phone calls, an unidentified militant allegedly speaks with a Russian Cossack, Mykola Kozitsyn. Militant: \"On TV, they say like it is a Ukrainian An-26, a transport plane. But the writing says 'Malaysia Airlines.' What was it doing over the territory of Ukraine?\" Kozitsyn: \"Well then it was bringing spies. Why the hell were they flying? This is war going on.\" While these recordings have garnered worldwide attention, they are not the first alleged intercepted calls that Ukrainian officials have released. Others were released earlier this month. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin told CNN on Friday that the phone calls were intercepted at the same time that the plane was shot down. Yatsenyuk called for international support \"to bring to justice all these bastards who committed this international crime.\" Russia has not directly responded to the content of the audio, but President Vladimir Putin has blamed Ukraine for the crash. \"This tragedy would not have happened if there had been peace on that land, or in any case, if military operations in southeastern Ukraine had not been renewed,\" he said. An additional set of recordings released by Ukrainian intelligence officials Friday is said to link the rebels to the time that the missile allegedly took down the plane. One recording, purportedly between the military chief of the separatist Lugansk National Republic and a Russian military intelligence officer, discusses the missile system, called a Buk. The alleged rebel is heard telling the supposed Russian officer that they hold the Buk. \"Yes, I know that,\" the Russian officer responds.

{"text": "Hit by two astonishing tragedies in quick succession, the Malaysia Airlines brand may become the airline industry's equivalent of asbestos or News of the World: toxic to the public and, experts say, impossible to redeem. Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was downed over eastern Ukraine on Thursday with 298 people aboard by what American intelligence authorities believe was a surface-to-air missile. Just four months earlier, a Malaysia Airlines jetliner carrying 239 people disappeared about an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur. The jet has still not been found, a source of profound unease for travelers and the aviation industry. \"I can't comprehend of anything they can do to save themselves,\" said Mohshin Aziz, an aviation analyst at Maybank in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. \"Perception-wise it really hits home,\" Aziz said. \"It's very difficult to fight against negative perception.\" Even before the Flight 370 mystery, state-owned Malaysia Airlines was in serious financial trouble. In an industry infamous for impoverishing shareholders and irking customers, Malaysia Airlines had long stood out for its years of restructurings and losses. The Flight 370 disaster along with the often erratic response of Malaysia Airlines and the Malaysian government deeply scarred the carrier. Now, the once proud national airline is facing the unthinkable again. University student Dayne Rodgers, waiting for a flight to Brisbane, Australia at Incheon International Airport in South Korea, said even very cheap fares might not convince him to fly with Malaysia Airlines. \"I don't know if my Mum would let me,\" he said. Already losing about $1.6 million a day, there will be \"no miracles\" for Malaysia Airlines, said Aziz, the Maybank analyst. Before the Ukrainian disaster, his opinion was the airline didn't have the capacity to survive beyond a year. The airline's share price plummeted 11 percent Friday. Ukraine has accused pro-Russian separatists of shooting down the plane flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. The rebels denied it. Unlike Flight 370, the responsibility for which is pinned with Malaysia Airlines, the second disaster appears largely beyond the airline's control. It may, however, face questions about why it continued with flight paths over eastern Ukraine, which is the heart of a violent rebellion against Kiev, when some airlines were circumventing the country. The flight route was declared safe by the International Civil Aviation Organization. For air travelers in Asia, who have a multitude of options thanks to a budget airline boom, the latest incident will make the Malaysian carrier even less attractive. Its brand in the rest of the world, where it became known largely because of the Flight 370 mystery, is now even more closely associated with the worst fears of fliers. Josh Gokul, a 25-year-old Australian student on a layover at Incheon, said he had flown with Malaysian Airlines before and its service was \"fantastic.\" But he is now \"very hesitant\" about using the airline. \"Flying is scary enough.\" Within Malaysia, the shock is palpably raw. \"I was stunned,\" said 48-year-old shopkeeper Reezal Mohamed. \"It's unbelievable.\" Malaysia Airlines has been in the red for the last three years. Last year, its losses ballooned to 1.17 billion ringgit ($363 million), nearly three times larger than its 433 million ringgit loss in 2012. As a state-owned flag carrier, it is required to fly unprofitable domestic routes, and its strong union has resisted operational changes. Nimbler discount rivals such as Air Asia have expanded rapidly, while Malaysia Airlines has been like a supertanker, slow to change direction. For some travelers, the airline's poor financial health is more concerning for the future than the two disasters. \"Last time I saw them, the plane was almost empty and so I suspect, probably losing a lot of money,\" said tourist Ricky Leong as he checked in for a Malaysia Airlines flight from Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur. \"They're not going to maintain their fleet and there's going to be issues in the future.\" After the disappearance of Flight 370, the biggest backlash emanated from China because its nationals were the majority of passengers on the flight. Hopes for a recovery in that crucial market might now be set back. Tongcheng Network Technology, which operates the Chinese ticket booking website ly.com, suspended all flight ticketing and hotel bookings involving Malaysia Airlines after Flight 370 vanished. \"Now there's this plane crash, we would be very unlikely to consider resuming it in the future,\" said the manager of its public relations department, who only gave her surname, Zhang. Crisis and risk management expert Kuniyoshi Shirai at A.C.E. Consulting in Tokyo said Malaysia Airlines must take dramatic steps such as replacing top executives in response to the disaster, which he blamed partly on the airline for flying over war-torn eastern Ukraine. \"Otherwise, you cannot regain the trust of either consumers or investors,\" he said.", "label": {"what": ["Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was downed over eastern Ukraine on Thursday", "a Malaysia Airlines jetliner carrying 239 people disappeared", "profound unease for travelers and the aviation industry", "state-owned Malaysia Airlines was in serious financial trouble", "Ukraine has accused pro-Russian separatists of shooting down the plane flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur", "The rebels denied it", "flight paths over eastern Ukraine", "The flight route was declared safe by the International Civil Aviation Organization", "the biggest backlash emanated from China"], "when": ["on Thursday", "four months earlier", "an hour after taking off", "a day", "a year", "Friday", "for the last three years", "Last year", "in 2012"], "where": ["over eastern Ukraine", "from Kuala Lumpur", "Malaysia", "to Brisbane, Australia", "at Incheon International Airport", "in South Korea", "Amsterdam", "at Incheon", "Hong Kong", "in that crucial market", "in Tokyo"], "why": ["for impoverishing shareholders and irking customers", "for its years of restructurings and losses", "thanks to a budget airline boom", "because of the Flight 370 mystery", "because its nationals were the majority of passengers on the flight", "for flying over war-torn eastern Ukraine"], "who": ["experts", "American intelligence authorities", "239 people", "Mohshin Aziz, an aviation analyst at Maybank", "Malaysia Airlines", "the Malaysian government", "University student Dayne Rodgers", "Aziz, the Maybank analyst", "pro-Russian separatists", "The rebels", "Kiev", "the International Civil Aviation Organization", "air travelers in Asia", "fliers", "Josh Gokul, a 25-year-old Australian student", "48-year-old shopkeeper Reezal Mohamed", "a state-owned flag carrier", "Air Asia", "tourist Ricky Leong", "Tongcheng Network Technology", "the manager of its public relations department", "Zhang", "Crisis and risk management expert Kuniyoshi Shirai at A.C.E.

Some 298 people were on the Boeing 777 Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur flight, which crashed in eastern Ukraine prompting claims it was shot down. A Downing Street spokesman said it was \"increasingly likely\" separatists near the Torez area had shot down the plane. British air accident investigators are being deployed to the scene. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch said it was sending a team to assist with the investigation, while British police officers are also travelling to Ukraine to help repatriate bodies. Speaking after he chaired a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee on Friday, the UK prime minister described the tragedy as \"absolutely appalling, shocking, horrific incident\". He said it \"cannot be allowed to stand\". British passengers believed to have died in the tragedy include: John Alder and Liam Sweeney, who were understood to have been travelling to New Zealand to watch Newcastle United's pre-season tour of the country Glenn Thomas, 49, a press officer at the World Health Organization (WHO) and a former BBC journalist Ben Pocock, a student at Loughborough University, who had been heading to Australia Richard Mayne, a student at Leeds University, originally from Leicestershire Cameron Dalziel, who was born in Zimbabwe and lived in South Africa, but was travelling on a British passport 'Tremendous bloke' Mr Sweeney's father Barry said he had been unable to find out what had happened via official channels and discovered his son had died from a post on Newcastle United's website. \"I was hurt because I think we should've known,\" he told the BBC. \"I tried to go through the legal way, ringing all the emergency lines or whatever.\" Barry Sweeney said he would rather it had been him on the plane, saying of his son: \"I just want everybody to know what a tremendous bloke he is.\" A statement from the club paid tribute to Mr Alder and Mr Sweeney, who it said were \"two of the club's most loyal supporters\". Club manager Alan Pardew said: \"Myself and all the players are deeply shocked and saddened by this terrible news\". Newcastle's players are to wear black armbands for both their games against Sydney FC and Wellington Phoenix in New Zealand. It has emerged that Mr Thomas had been travelling to Australia to attend an international conference on Aids. WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib said: \"For the time being we would like to give his family time to grieve. \"We have lost a wonderful person and a great professional. Our hearts are broken. We are all in shock.\" Richard Porter, controller of English services for BBC World Service Group, also paid tribute to ex-colleague Mr Thomas, who he said was a \"much loved and respected\" journalist. He said Mr Thomas' interest in journalism was \"only matched by his interest in humanitarian issues\" and said former workmates were \"reeling\" from the news. 'Warm and caring' John Wood, headmaster at Mr Mayne's former school, Dixie Grammar in Leicestershire, described him as \"a great all-rounder, good academically and also a keen sportsman\". He added: \"The thoughts of all of us at The Dixie Grammar School are with Richard's family and friends at this most difficult time; he will be sorely missed.\" Mr Pocock 's family said in a statement that he was travelling to Western Australia as part of university exchange. They added: \"He was a gifted academic, talented athlete but more importantly a warm, caring, fun-loving son and brother who had an extremely bright future ahead of him.\" On Friday evening, a Downing Street spokesman said \"the growing weight of evidence\" suggested the plane was brought down by a separatist missile from near Torez. Prime Minister David Cameron said those responsible must be \"brought to account\". The Foreign Office is offering consular assistance to families and has sent extra staff to Ukraine. At an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council called by Britain on Friday, the UK's ambassador Sir Mark Lyall Grant said \"searching questions\" had to be asked about Russia's links with armed separatists and called for Moscow to issue an \"unequivocal condemnation\" of their actions. The Security Council also approved a statement calling for a \"full, thorough and independent international investigation\" into the tragedy. Mr Cameron is also expected to speak to Russian president Vladimir Putin on Friday. Some nationalities unverified The Duke of Cambridge also spoke of his \"deep sadness\" over the crash during a speech at a planned event at Australia House in London. \"For all of us who have lost fellow countrymen and women in the tragedy, words cannot do justice to our sense of loss,\" he said. The UK Foreign Office has set up a helpline on 020 7008 1500, while anyone concerned could also text MH17 to +44 7860010026, or fill in an online form. Flight MH17 came down between Krasni Luch, in Luhansk region, and Shakhtarsk in the neighbouring region of Donetsk - 50km from the Russia-Ukraine border. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said \"no stone will be left unturned\" in the investigation into what happened. Mr Najib said the passengers and crew had come from many different countries. He added: \"Today, regardless of nationality, we are all united in grief.\" The UK Foreign Office confirmed 10 UK nationals were on board. Latest figures released by Malaysia Airlines show the plane was also carrying at least 189 Dutch nationals, 27 Australians, 44 Malaysians - including 15 crew - and 12 Indonesians. There were also passengers from Germany, Belgium, the Philippines and Canada, the airline has said. Avoiding airspace Ukraine's president has called the loss of the plane an \"act of terrorism\" as the separatist rebels denied shooting it down. Meanwhile, leading airlines have announced they are now avoiding airspace surrounding eastern Ukraine. The Department for Transport said flights that were already airborne were being routed around the area. British Airways said the safety and security of its customers was its top priority. It added: \"Our flights are not using Ukrainian airspace, with the exception of our once a day service between Heathrow and Kiev. \"We are keeping those services under review, but Kiev is several hundred kilometres from the incident site.\" Virgin Atlantic said it was re-routing \"a small number of flights\".", "label": {"what": ["prompting claims", "shot down the plane", "he chaired a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee", "described the tragedy as 'absolutely appalling, shocking, horrific incident'", "He said it 'cannot be allowed to stand'", "travelling on a British passport", "he had been unable to find out what had happened", "A statement from the club paid tribute to Mr Alder and Mr Sweeney", "Myself and all the players are deeply shocked and saddened by this terrible news", "We have lost a wonderful person and a great professional", "paid tribute to ex-colleague Mr Thomas", "described him as 'a great all-rounder, good academically and also a keen sportsman'", "former workmates were 'reeling' from the news", "Some nationalities unverified", "The Duke of Cambridge also spoke of his 'deep sadness' over the crash", "we are all united", "denied shooting it down"], "when": ["on Friday", "For the time being", "at this most difficult time", "On Friday evening", "during a speech", "Today", "Meanwhile"], "where": ["on Malaysia Airlines flight MH17", "on the Boeing 777 Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur flight", "in eastern Ukraine", "near the Torez area", "the scene", "from Leicestershire", "in Zimbabwe", "in South Africa", "on Newcastle United's website", "on the plane", "in New Zealand", "Western Australia", "near Torez", "At an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council", "at Australia House in London", "between Krasni Luch, in Luhansk region, and Shakhtarsk in the neighbouring region of Donetsk -

{"text": "Malaysia Airlines says that in the wake of the shooting down of one of its passenger jets over Ukraine, it has changed the route it planes will take on flights to and from Europe. The airline said in a statement Friday on its website that all of its European flights \"will be taking alternative routes avoiding the usual route.\" The plane, which was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, crashed Thursday with 298 people on board Flight 17. American intelligence authorities believe a surface-to-air missile brought the aircraft down but it was not yet clear who fired it. \"The usual flight route was earlier declared safe by the International Civil Aviation Organization. International Air Transportation Association has stated that the airspace the aircraft was traversing was not subject to restrictions,\" the airline said in a statement on its website. Even though there were no restrictions, Malaysia Airlines may still face questions about why it continued with flight paths over eastern Ukraine  at the heart of a violent rebellion against Kiev  when some airlines decided months ago to change routes to skip around the area. In Seoul, Asiana spokeswoman Lee Hyomin said Asiana had a once-a-week cargo flight that had flown over Ukraine but re-routed the flight in early March amid the worsening situation over the Crimean peninsula. Korean Air Line also said it had rerouted cargo and passenger flights in early March amid the worsening situation over the Crimean peninsula. A company official, who requested anonymity in line with department rules, said Korean Air Line had had 42 flights  26 cargo and 16 passenger flights  which flew over Ukraine before. Likewise, Australia's Qantas stopped flying over Ukraine several months ago and shifted its London-Dubai route 645 kilometers (400 miles) to the south. A spokeswoman declined to explain the change. The China Civil Aviation Administration said it instructed all domestic airlines to avoid flying over Ukraine. At present, there are a total of 28 round-trip Chinese flights a week that fly over the area. A statement from Hong Kong's Civil Aviation Department said local \"airlines do not use air routes that cross Ukrainian airspace.\" Aviation authorities in several countries, including the FAA in the United States, had issued warnings not to fly over parts of Ukraine prior to Thursday's crash, but many carriers, including cash-strapped Malaysia Airlines, had continued to use the route because \"it is a shorter route, which means less fuel and therefore less money,\" said aviation expert Norman Shanks.", "label": {"what": ["it has changed the route it planes will take on flights to and from Europe", "The plane, which was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, crashed", "it was not yet clear who fired it", "The usual flight route was earlier declared safe", "the airspace the aircraft was traversing was not subject to restrictions", "Malaysia Airlines may still face questions", "Korean Air Line had had 42 flights 26 cargo and 16 passenger flights which flew over Ukraine before", "requested anonymity", "A spokeswoman declined to explain the change", "there are a total of 28 round-trip Chinese flights a week that fly over the area", "continued to use the route"], "when": ["Friday", "Thursday", "months ago", "in early March", "several months ago", "At present", "a week"], "where": ["over Ukraine", "to and from Europe", "in a statement", "on its website", "from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia", "the airspace the aircraft was traversing", "over eastern Ukraine", "In Seoul", "over the Crimean peninsula", "645 kilometers (400 miles) to the south", "London-Dubai", "cross Ukrainian airspace", "in several countries", "in the United States"], "why": ["the shooting down of one of its passenger jets", "a surface-to-air missile brought the aircraft down", "it continued with flight paths over eastern Ukraine", "the heart of a violent rebellion against Kiev", "to skip around the area", "the worsening situation over the Crimean peninsula", "in line with department rules", "it is a shorter route, which means less fuel and therefore less money"], "who": ["Malaysia Airlines", "one of its passenger jets", "all of its European flights", "298 people", "American intelligence authorities", "the International Civil Aviation Organization", "International Air Transportation Association", "Asiana spokeswoman Lee Hyomin", "Kiev", "Korean Air Line", "A company official", "Australia's Qantas", "A spokeswoman", "The China Civil Aviation Administration", "all domestic airlines", "Hong Kong's Civil Aviation Department", "Aviation authorities", "the FAA", "many carriers, including cash-strapped Malaysia Airlines", "aviation expert Norman Shanks"], "how": ["Asiana had a once-a-week cargo flight that had flown over Ukraine but re-routed the flight", "Korean Air Line also said it had rerouted cargo and passenger flights", "Australia's Qantas stopped flying over Ukraine several months ago and shifted its London-Dubai route 645 kilometers (400 miles) to the south"], "damages": ["crashed Thursday with 298 people on board Flight 17", "Thursday's crash"], "countermeasures": ["taking alternative routes avoiding the usual route", "some airlines decided months ago to change routes", "instructed all domestic airlines to avoid flying over Ukraine", "local 'airlines do not use air routes that cross Ukrainian airspace.'", "issued warnings not to fly over parts of Ukraine"]}}
{"text": "Malaysia Airlines was still reeling from the impact of flight MH370's March disappearance when news of MH17's crash in Ukraine broke on Thursday. Now many question whether the carrier can survive a second disaster in such a short time. \"It is a tragedy with no comparison. In the history of aviation, no airline has gone through two tragedies of this magnitude in a span of four months,\" said Mohsin Aziz, an aviation analyst at Maybank. \"Even before the second incident, I have been very sceptical over the company's ability to survive beyond the second half of 2015. They are making huge losses  This is probably going to hasten that. \"It doesn't matter who is at fault. The perception to the customer is 'I don't want to fly Malaysia Airlines any more', and to battle that is not easy.\" Shares in the carrier fell sharply on Friday, down 11% by the midday break in trading in Kuala Lumpur, as already negative investor sentiment deepened. In all, it has dropped by 35% this year. Questions were also raised about the airline's choice of route, after it emerged that some other carriers had avoided the area for months  though many companies were flying in the same area, rerouting only after Thursday's disaster. The carrier, and the Malaysian government, came under heavy criticism for its handling of MH370's disappearance  particularly in China, which lost more than 150 nationals in that disaster. While any airline and any nation would have struggled with the extraordinary twists and turns in a mystery that remains unresolved, relatives complained of confused and contradictory information and insensitivity on the part of the government and company. At Kuala Lumpur International airport on Thursday night, angry relatives demanded to see the passenger manifest, but could not find a Malaysia Airlines official, Reuters reported. \"We have been waiting for four hours. We found out the news from international media. Facebook is more efficient than MAS. It's so funny, they are a laughing stock,\" one young man told reporters angrily. While the two Malaysia Airlines flight disasters are clearly very different, the uncanny coincidences are likely to resonate. \"This comes very close [in time]; it was the same airline; the same aeroplane type. It happened outside the more common way of crashing for big airlines; most accidents happen close to landing or just after takeoff. They both have an element of mystery and perhaps unlawful and external interference,\" noted Sidney Dekker, an expert on aviation safety at Griffith University. \"If the public is willing to keep them separate and say they really have little to do with each other, and any common link is not Malaysia Airlines, you can probably survive with the brand relatively intact,\" he said. But that is a big if. Five years after Trans World Airlines flight 800 crashed into the ocean near New York in 1996 with the loss of 230 lives, the carrier filed for bankruptcy and was acquired by American Airlines. For an already troubled company, the disaster was the straw that broke the camel's back, said Dekker. For others, a disaster may well mean \"rebranding, rebadging, a new air operator's certificate\". The Malaysian transport minister, Liao Tiong Lai, declined to comment on the airline's future at a press conference about the disaster on Friday, describing that as a separate issue. Prior to MH370's disappearance, Malaysia Airlines was making losses but seemed to be improving, said Mohsin; it was reducing operating costs and selling more tickets. But while its flights were increasingly full, it had not managed to bump up its fares. Now the airline's previously strong safety record has effectively been erased for passengers by two such losses. According to the International Air Transport Association, there were an average of 517 deaths annually in commercial aviation incidents between 2009 and 2013. Now a single airline appears to have surpassed that death toll in a single year. \"People are only willing to fly with Malaysia Airlines if the ticket price is really, really cheap,\" said Mohsin. The airline has also faced additional costs, such as supporting the families of victims and increasing its spending on marketing. Reuters reported earlier this month that Malaysian state investor Khazanah Nasional Bhd planned to take MAS private as the first step towards restructuring the company, citing two unnamed sources. \"For it to completely disappear would be too much of a loss of pride for Malaysia,\" said the Maybank analyst. \"It is more realistic or probable for the government to intervene directly or via Khazanah.\" One key question is whether the airline should have chosen another course for the Boeing-777, given that two aircraft had been downed in the region that week. Malaysia Airlines said early on Friday: \"The usual flight route was earlier declared safe by the International Civil Aviation Organisation. International Air Transport Association has stated that the airspace the aircraft was traversing was not subject to restrictions.\" Cathay Pacific, Australia's Qantas and Korea's two major carriers are among airlines that stopped flying over Ukrainian airspace months ago due to concerns. \"Although the detour adds to flight time and cost, we have been making the detour for safety, and until the Ukrainian situation is over we will continue to take the detour route for our cargo flight out of Brussels,\" an Asiana Airlines Inc spokeswoman told Reuters. But many major players were still flying through the area, though Malaysia Airlines, Singapore Airlines and others, such as China Eastern, have stopped using that airspace in the wake of the disaster. \"'What's wrong with Malaysia Airlines?' is completely the wrong question to ask and will lead us down a rabbit hole of entirely useless thinking,\" said aviation expert Dekker. \"It is pure chance. I flew through Ukrainian airspace on Monday with my daughter. It could have been us.\" While pilots ultimately have the discretion to refuse to fly along a particular course if they have concerns, they do not make the routes. Those are based on a multitude of factors, including airspace charges and wind speeds that affect journey times, but also, of course, safety. While the US Federal Aviation Authority had cautioned American carriers not to fly over the Crimean peninsula, there was no such warning for the area where MH17 came down. Ukrainian officials had closed airspace to 32,000ft (9,750 metres), but MH17 was flying 1,000ft above that. \"What I have heard raised in various guises is the broader question: can we come to more efficient international agreements about where to avoid flying and where to fly?\" said Dekker.", "label": {"what": ["Malaysia Airlines was still reeling from the impact of flight MH370's March disappearance", "Now many question whether the carrier can survive", "I have been very sceptical over the company's ability to survive beyond the second half of 2015", "In all, it has dropped by 35%", "Questions were also raised about the airline's choice of route", "many companies were flying in the same area", "came under heavy criticism", "relatives complained", "demanded to see the passenger manifest, but could not find a Malaysia Airlines official", "We have been waiting", "We found out the news from international media", "the carrier filed for bankruptcy and was acquired by American Airlines", "declined to comment on the airline's future", "describing that as a separate issue", "Malaysia Airlines was making losses but seemed to be improving", "selling more tickets", "its flights were increasingly full", "it had not managed to bump up its fares", "The usual flight route was earlier declared safe by the International Civil Aviation Organisation", "the airspace the aircraft was traversing was not subject to restrictions", "the detour adds to flight time and cost", "many major players were still flying through the area", "I flew through Ukrainian airspace on Monday with my daughter", "pilots ultimately have the discretion to refuse to fly along a particular course if they have concerns", "they do not make the routes", "no such warning for the area where MH17 came down"], "when": ["March", "on Thursday", "when news of MH17's crash in Ukraine broke", "in such a short time", "In the history of aviation", "in a span of four months", "Now", "before the second incident", "the second half of 2015", "on Friday", "this year", "for months", "on Thursday night", "for four hours", "Five years after Trans World Airlines flight 800 crashed", "in 1996", "Prior to MH370's disappearance", "between 2009 and 2013", "in a single year", "earlier this month", "that week", "early on Friday", "months ago", "until the Ukrainian situation is over", "on Monday"], "where": ["in Ukraine", "in Kuala Lumpur", "in the same area", "in China", "At Kuala Lumpur International airport", "the ocean near New York", "at a press conference about the disaster", "in the region", "the airspace the aircraft was traversing", "over Ukrainian airspace", "through the area", "over the Crimean peninsula", "the area where MH17 came down", "airspace to 32,000ft (9,750 metres)", "1,000ft above that"], "why": ["flight MH370's March disappearance", "MH17's crash", "a second disaster", "no airline has gone through two tragedies of this magnitude", "making huge losses", "Thursday's disaster", "for its handling of MH370's disappearance", "confused and contradictory information and insensitivity on the part of the government and company", "a mystery that remains unresolved", "most accidents happen close to landing or just after takeoff", "an element of mystery and perhaps unlawful and external interference", "the disaster was the straw that broke the camel's back", "by two such losses", "the ticket price is really, really cheap", "The airline has also faced additional costs", "increasing its spending on marketing", "to completely disappear would be too much of a loss of pride for Malaysia", "two aircraft had been downed", "due to concerns"], "who": ["Malaysia Airlines", "flight MH370", "many", "Mohsin Aziz, an aviation analyst at Maybank", "the carrier", "the customer", "many companies", "the Malaysian government", "150 nationals", "any airline and any nation", "angry relatives", "Reuters", "one young man", "reporters", "Facebook", "MAS", "Sidney Dekker, an expert on aviation safety at Griffith University", "Trans World Airlines flight 800", "American Airlines", "an already troubled company", "The Malaysian transport minister, Liao Tiong Lai", "Mohsin", "passengers", "the International Air Transport Association", "Malaysian state investor Khazanah Nasional Bhd", "Maybank analyst", "the government", "the Boeing-777", "the International Civil Aviation Organisation", "International Air Transport Association", "Cathay Pacific, Australia's Qantas and Korea's two major carriers", "an Asiana Airlines Inc spokeswoman", "many major players", "Singapore Airlines and others, such as China Eastern", "my daughter", "pilots", "the US Federal Aviation Authority", "Ukrainian officials"], "how": ["a tragedy with no comparison", "the two Malaysia Airlines flight disasters are clearly very different", "This comes very close [in time];

{"text": "Malaysia's airline workers have reacted with horror and anger at the fate of flight MH17, with officials saying the industry may take years to recover from two such trauamtic incidents in such a short space of time. The National Union of Flight Attendants held a brief press conference at the Sama-Sama hotel at Kuala Lumpur international airport on Saturday evening, and said they were \"deeply sad and shocked\" by the news that MH17 had likely been shot down by separatists. Malaysia was still reeling from the loss of MH370, he said, which disappeared from radar screens on 8 March and has not yet been found. \"Here we go again with [another in a] series of tragic incidents,\" he said. \"This is something I think a lot of our crew members are unable to accept at this moment in time  we cannot believe that this incident could happen in such a short period and it happened to Malaysia Airlines again.\" The union lost 21 members in the two incidents, and as a result some flight attendants are now so psychologically disturbed that they no longer want to fly. \"We are very sad, very depressed,\" Ismail said of the union as a whole. \"The crew members [have been] demoralised by this tragic incident.\" Lawyers from an international legal firm specialising in aviation claims told the Guardian that hardly any of the family members of those on board MH370 had been interested in filing insurance claims against Boeing, which operates the 777 aircraft, because they still hoped their loved ones were alive. Only one family member has filed a claim, which could result in compensation of between $450,000 (263,000) and $1m, since the plane disappeared from radar screens. It is presumed to have crashed in the South Indian Ocean. \"We're trying to encourage people to make a claim because they've lost family members who earned money and maybe they have parents who are ill or young children who will go to college, and who will pay for that?\" said one of the lawyers, who spoke anonymously because she was not permitted to speak to the media. \"But they say, 'They're still alive, they'll be back one day.'

{"text": "U.S. intelligence assessments suggest that Russia provided separatists in eastern Ukraine with sophisticated antiaircraft systems in recent weeks, including the missile that brought down a Malaysia Airlines plane, killing all 298 aboard, two senior U.S. officials told Fox News late Saturday. The Wall Street Journal first reported Saturday that U.S. officials suspect that the SA-11 antiaircraft systems were smuggled into Ukraine along with other military equipment, including tanks. The Journal also reported that officials believe the systems were moved back into Russia following Thursday's crash, buttressing speculation that the Russians were attempting to remove evidence of their involvement in the tragedy. The officials told Fox News that President Barack Obama received \"multiple\" intelligence assessments regarding the crash of Flight MH17 at Camp David, where he is spending the weekend. The president's national security aides also held several meetings to discuss the situation in Ukraine, where separatists are reportedly limiting international investigators' access to the crash site. Secretary of State John Kerry will appear on all five Sunday morning talk shows, including \"Fox News Sunday,\" and is expected to aggressively pin the blame on Russia for the downed airliner. Kerry is also expected to call for investigators to have \"unfettered access\" to the crash site, restating a message he delivered to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov when the two spoke Saturday. The missile is the latest piece of evidence tying the jet tragedy to Moscow and its separatist clients. Earlier Saturday, U.S. officials told Fox News that senior Western intelligence officials believe they have found evidence that the Russian commander Igor \"Strelkov\" Girkin oversaw the deadly missile strike. Girkin, whose nom de guerre means shooter in Russian, is the Russian commander who has overseen the uprising of ethnic Russians in eastern Ukraine over roughly the past four months. Girkin is a retired Russian military intelligence officer who purportedly served in the Russian FSB, the countrys internal security unit -- a part of the KGB that was renamed after the Soviet Union fell apart. U.S. officials think Girkin oversaw the missile strike in part because of social media posts he made shortly after the Malaysian plane went down. And they have an intercepted phone conversation purportedly between a Girkin lieutenant and a handler in the Russian military intelligence service in which the fighter seems to say his team shot down the plane. Girkin purportedly posted online: Near (Snizhne) right now was hit an airplane An-26. It is somewhere behind the mine Progress,  Girkin added. Girkin previously served in Chechnya to put down an uprising against Moscow and led the Russian incursion into Crimea, in eastern Ukraine, earlier this year. About five weeks ago, Girkin, who is not a Ukrainian, reportedly sought help from Moscow because he said the local ethnic Russians in Ukraine did not want to fight.

The report referred to them as \"terrorists.\" Police said they killed at least four attackers and shot and wounded a female suspect. Authorities were searching for other suspects. The killing spree came out of nowhere. Yang Haifei, a resident of Yunnan, told Xinhua he was buying a ticket when a group of people, most of them in black, rushed into the station with knives. \"I saw a person come straight at me with a long knife and I ran away with everyone,\" he said, adding that people who were slower were severely injured. \"They just fell on the ground.\" He said he sustained injuries to his chest and back.

In the aftermath, postings on Sina Weibo, another Twitter-like social medium, showed local police patrolling the station, with bodies in blood lying on the ground. Chinese state TV showed investigators putting a knife with a blade at least 2 feet long into an evidence bag. Mass knife attacks are not unprecedented in China.

{"text": "BEIJING V  Authorities on Sunday blamed a slashing rampage that killed 29 people and wounded 143 at a train station in southern China on separatists from the country's far west, while local residents said government crackdowns had taken their toll on the alleged culprits. Police fatally shot four of the assailants -- putting the overall death toll at 33 -- and captured another after the attack late Saturday in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, the official Xinhua News Agency said. But authorities were searching for at least five more of the black-clad attackers. State broadcaster CCTV said two of the assailants were women, including one of the slain and the one detained. \"All-out efforts should be made to treat the injured people, severely punish terrorists according to the law, and prevent the occurrence of similar cases,\" said China's top police official, Politburo member Meng Jianzhu, who arrived in Kunming early Sunday, an indication of how seriously authorities viewed the attack. The attackers' identities have not been confirmed, but evidence at the scene showed that it was \"a terrorist attack carried out by Xinjiang separatist forces,\" Xinhua said. The far western region of Xinjiang is home to a simmering rebellion against Chinese rule by some members of the Muslim Uighur population, and the government has responded there with heavy-handed security. Police in Kunming on Sunday were rounding up members of the city's small Uighur community, believed to number no more than several dozen, for questioning in the attack and information about the assailants. \"How do we know them?\" said a Uighur man who gave only his first name, Akpar. \"We could not tell if the assailants were Uighurs as they were all dressed in black. We did not like the attack either.\" Most attacks blamed on Uighur separatists take place in Xinjiang, where clashes between Uighurs and police or members of China's ethnic Han majority are frequent, but Saturday's assault happened more than 1,500 kilometers (more than 900 miles) to the southeast in Yunnan, which has not had a history of such unrest. Kunming residents expressed dismay at both the attack and the conditions within China that could have allowed it to happen. Restaurant worker Xie Yulong said the attackers were \"worse than animals.\" But he also expressed sympathy toward ethnic Uighurs, saying their region has come under severe security crackdowns in recent months under the government of President Xi Jinping. \"It's the pressure,\" Xie said. \"Beijing has put too much pressure on them since Xi Jinping took over. They are under so much pressure they do not want to live, and they did that.\" Another Kunming resident, Jiang Hua, said the attack has made people scared to go out at night. \"I think we should chase off the Uighurs and let them be independent,\" Jiang said. \"And local authorities should be held accountable for providing public safety.\" Witnesses described assailants dressed in black storming the train station late Saturday evening and slashing people indiscriminately with large knives and machetes. Student Qiao Yunao, 16, was waiting to catch a train at the station when people started crying out and running, and then saw a man cut another man's neck, drawing blood. \"I was freaking out, and ran to a fast food store, and many people were running in there to take refuge,\" she told The Associated Press via Sina Weibo, a Chinese microblog. \"I saw two attackers, both men, one with a watermelon knife and the other with a fruit knife. They were running and chopping whoever they could.\" Alarms over a possible spread of militant attacks to soft targets beyond the borders of Xinjiang were first raised in October when a suicide car attack blamed on three ethnic Uighurs killed five people, including the attackers, at Beijing's Tiananmen Gate. Sean Roberts, a cultural anthropologist at George Washington University who has studied Uighurs and China for two decades, said the Kunming violence would be a new kind of attack for ethnic Uighurs -- premeditated, well-organized and outside Xinjiang -- but still rudimentary in weaponry. \"If it is true that it was carried out by Uighurs, it's much different than anything we've seen to date,\" Roberts said by phone. But he added that it is still unclear whether there is any organized Uighur militant group, and that attacks so far do not appear linked to any \"global terrorist network, because we're not seeing things like sophisticated explosives or essentially sophisticated tactics.\" The violence in Kunming came at a sensitive time, with political leaders in Beijing preparing for Wednesday's opening of the annual legislature, where Xi's government will deliver its first one-year work report. Willy Lam, a political observer at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said the attack coming so close to the National People's Congress dented Xi's message of a \"Chinese Dream\" coalescing under his rule. \"Pockets of dissatisfaction, groups of people with grievances, appear to be increasing. After 1 1/2 years of more heavy-handed control (in Xinjiang), the report card does not look good,\" Lam said. Xi called for \"all-out efforts\" to bring the culprits to justice. The Security Management Bureau, which is under the Ministry of Public Security, said in a statement that police would \"crack down on the crimes in accordance with the law without any tolerance.\" The attack was the deadliest violence attributed to Uighur-Han conflicts since riots in the Xinjiang capital of Urumqi in 2009, in which Uighurs stormed the streets of the city, targeting Han people in seemingly random violence that included the killing of women and children. A few days later, Han vigilante mobs armed with sticks and bats attacked Uighurs in the same city.

{"text": "Beijing: Twenty-eight people were killed and 113 others injured in a \"violent terrorist attack\" when a group of unidentified men armed with knives attacked a railway station in China's southwestern Kunming city on Saturday. A group of unknown knife-wielding men attacked the Kunming Railway Station in the capital city of southwestern China's Yunnan province at around 9 pm (local time), causing death and injuries, city police said without providing the\nidentity of the attackers. \"It was an organised, premeditated violent terrorist attack,\" state-run Xinhua news agency reported confirming that 28 people were killed and 113 injured in the incident which is the biggest terrorist attack outside the restive northwestern Xinjiang province. The agency reported that several suspects have been \"controlled\", while police are still investigating people in the station. Local television station K6 said police shot dead a number of the perpetrators at the train station. Fire fighters and medical workers have arrived on the scene, and injured people have been rushed to hospital for emergency treatment. The arterial road of the station has been cordoned off, the Xinhua report said. A dozen bodies were seen at the hospital. As of midnight more than 60 victims in the attack have been sent to hospital, emergency registration records showed, the report said. Yang Haifei, a local resident of Yunnan who was attacked and sustained injuries on his chest and back, said he saw a group of people rush into the station with black uniforms and start attacking others as he was buying his ticket. \"I saw a person come straight at me with a long knife and I ran away with everyone,\" he said, adding that people who were slower were severely injured. \"They just fell on the ground,\" he said. Kunming Railway Station, located in the southeast of the city, is one of the largest stations in southwest China. At the guard pavilion in front of the station, three victims were crying. One of them, a woman named Yang Ziqing told Xinhua that they were waiting in the station square for a train to Shanghai, but had to escape when a knife-wielding man suddenly came at them. \"My two town-fellows' husbands have been rushed to hospital, but I can't find my husband, and his phone went unanswered,\" Yang sobbed. Pictures on Weibo showed local police patrolling the station with bodies in blood lying on the ground. Doctors were transporting the injured to a local hospital. Another post on Weibo by a passenger present at the station said she was dining in a nearby restaurant when the attack took place. She said she was \"scared to death,\" seeing a group of men in black with two long knives chasing people. State-run CCTV said Chinese President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang have directed a top security official to visit Kunming city to investigate the attack. According to the Kunming railway bureau, train departures have not been affected. The attack comes ahead of the meeting of the Chinese parliament next week. The origin of the attackers is not yet known or whether they hailed from Xinjiang where China says the East Turkestan\\ Islamic Movement (ETIM), an al-Qaeda-linked group is stirring up a separatist movement among ethnic Muslim Uyghurs. Several such attacks have taken place in Xinjiang in recent months as the remote province has been witnessing ethnic unrest between the native Muslim Uyghurs and Han Chinese from the mainland for the past few years. Three people were killed in an attack by the ETIM at the iconic Tiananmen Square in Beijing last year, when a car crashed into a crowd of tourists. China in the recent past has also witnessed stray knife attacks by disgruntled elements as well as attempts by frustrated individuals to set fire to passenger buses to vent their anger over a host of social issues.

{"text": "China says the vicious slashing spree that killed 29 people in a southern city was the work of separatists linked to international terrorism, but the assailants' homespun methods and low-tech weapons X nothing more than long knives X have led some analysts to suspect they didn't get outside help. Officials have blamed secessionists from far-western Xinjiang for Saturday's attack at a train station in Kunming, more than 1,500 kilometers (900 miles) to the southeast. It is by far the deadliest attack blamed on Xinjiang militants to have taken place outside the region, and has been a wake-up call for Chinese that terrorism can strike anywhere. Members of the Muslim Uighur (WEE-gur) ethnic group have waged a simmering rebellion against Chinese rule in Xinjiang, where clashes between Uighurs and members of China's Han majority are frequent. Many observers say the Turkic-speaking Uighurs are lashing out because they are being marginalized and feel their culture is being suppressed. Beijing uses its claim of an international conspiracy to defend its crackdown on Uighur dissent, but there hasn't been substantial evidence to support ties to foreign Muslim extremists. \"Historically, Uighurs have had a difficult time getting traction and attention from the global jihadist movement,\" said Raffaello Pantucci, London-based senior research fellow at Royal United Services Institute. \"We've had a number of videos in which senior members of al-Qaida have highlighted the cause and said this is a group to support and help, but in practical terms we have seen very little actually happen.\" No group has claimed responsibility for Saturday's attack, carried out by at least eight black-clad assailants. Although authorities have not explicitly mentioned the attackers' ethnicity, they have shown images of a black flag with a crescent moon said to have been found at the attack site. They cite the flags as evidence of involvement by the East Turkistan Islamic Movement, which the government says has ties to overseas supporters of Uighur separatism. They also say the high number of victims X 143 people wounded in addition to the 29 killed X is evidence the attackers had training. Sean Roberts of George Washington University's Elliott School of International Affairs, who has studied Uighurs in Central Asia and China, said the Kunming assailants' simple weaponry undermines claims of links to international terrorist groups, but said some Uighurs may be growing more militant. \"The ongoing development and further marginalization of the Uighurs, and particularly the suppression of Uighur dissent and constantly associating it with terrorism by the state, is likely to eventually lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" Roberts said. To China, even the attackers' clothes are a sign of foreign involvement. \"The attackers chose to dress in black, and black is the color of the holy war in international terrorist activities,\" Chinese anti-terrorism expert Li Wei said, reflecting the government view. Authorities in Kunming fatally shot four attackers Saturday night and detained one suspect X a woman. Two days later, police captured three others and said the attack was the work of an eight-person gang led by a person identified as Abdurehim Kurban, according to state media. Authorities have released no other details. Kunming has had little history of ethnic unrest, and residents there expressed shock and outrage. \"Kunming is a tourist city in China, and I could never have imagined this to happen here,\" said Chen Bin, a security guard. Although Beijing has long blamed the East Turkistan Islamic Movement for instigating violence in Xinjiang, many experts doubt it exists in any organized way. The U.S. added the group to its list of terrorist organizations in 2002, but later removed it. Uighur radicals are believed to be sheltering in lawless northern Pakistan, but it is unclear if they have any connection to attacks in China. Pantucci said that if the latest attack is connected to Xinjiang separatists, it would fit into an escalation of violence in the region over the last year, including several slashing attacks. He said both the Kunming attack and those in Xinjiang have lacked sophistication but could have been motivated by terrorist literature and videos. \"Even in some of the recent incidents that we have seen out in Xinjiang where they have tried to create explosive devices, we are talking very rudimentary devices that are essentially petrol bombs, gas canisters which they light up,\" Pantucci said. Pantucci said there may be more attempts to strike Chinese cities, but increased security will make them less likely to succeed. Alarm over militant attacks beyond Xinjiang was first raised in October when a suicide car attack blamed on three ethnic Uighurs killed five people, including the attackers, at Beijing's Tiananmen Gate. The latest attack came at a sensitive time, days ahead of Wednesday's opening of the ceremonial National People's Congress, and China has vowed to crack down on the perpetrators. Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said the Kunming attackers are the \"common enemy of the entire human race.\" Authorities on Sunday rounded up and questioned members of Kunming's Uighur community, which is believed to number only 40 to 60. At a barbeque stand of sizzling lamb skewers in the Uighur neighborhood, 19-year-old Aike Ainivan complained of discrimination. \"They call us Uighur dogs, and say we are either pickpockets or drug dealers,\" he said. He also condemned the train station attackers: \"I hate them.

{"text": "(Reuters) - Witnesses to chilling violence at a Chinese train station placed under heavy security on Sunday recalled moments of fear and chaos after at least 29 people were killed in what authorities called a terrorist attack by Xinjiang militants. Officials said a group of knife-wielding \"terrorists\" from the restive Xinjiang region launched a premeditated attack at the Kunming Railway Station in China's southwest on Saturday night. More than 130 people were wounded. Armed riot police stood guard as people streamed into the railway station on Sunday only hours after the attack, one of the worst of its kind in China in recent memory. Standing near shops about 50 meters from the site, a parking attendant surnamed Chen said he could not believe what was happening when he saw the attackers. \"I walked out and I saw a person with a knife this big, Chen said, spreading his arms wide. \"Then I saw five or six of them. They all had knives and they were stabbing people madly over by the first and second ticket offices,\" he said. Police shot four of the attackers dead and captured one, state news agency Xinhua reported. About five others were on the run, it said. Xinhua quoted the Kunming city government as saying evidence at the crime scene showed the attack was carried out by Xinjiang separatist forces. The attack comes at a sensitive time as China gears up for the annual meeting of its largely rubber-stamp parliament, which opens in Beijing on Wednesday and is normally accompanied by a tightening of security across the country. Word of the violence spread quickly, with graphic pictures that showed bodies covered in blood posted to the Twitter-like microblogging service Sina Weibo - posts that were later deleted by government censors. State television showed police wrapping a long, sword-like knife in a plastic bag. Shop and restaurant workers said hundreds of people had fled into their stores seeking refuge. \"Last night everyone ran over into my supermarket. The supermarket was full of people, including two passengers who had been stabbed,\" Ren Guangqin said inside his supermarket. \"I was terrified. They were killing people. How could I not be scared?\" said 28-year-old Ren. 'MOSTLY THEY WENT FOR THE HEAD AND SHOULDERS' Scores of patients from the attack spilled into corridors from overflowing wards at Kunming's No. 1 People's Hospital where they were being treated. In the neurosurgery department, several patients had head injuries. A 20-year-old university student, Wu Yuheng, said the attackers had tried to target people's heads. One had swiped his long knife and just nicked him on the scalp. \"I was terrified ... they attacked us like crazy swordsmen, and mostly they went for the head and the shoulders, those parts of the body to kill,\" he said, laying on a hospital bed in a hallway close to the elevators. \"This attack has caused great harm to innocent people but I think before we are sure about the identity of the attackers, we shouldn't make wild guesses on who to blame.\" China's domestic security chief, Meng Jianzhu, vowed those responsible would be brought to justice. \"This brutal attack on defenseless, innocent people by violent terrorists devoid of conscience exposes their inhuman and anti-social nature,\" Xinhua quoted Meng as saying. \"They inevitably will face the severe punishment of the law. We must mobilize all resources and adopt all means to break this case,\" Meng said, echoing comments made by Chinese President Xi Jinping. Meng, who is also a member of the ruling Communist Party's elite 25-member Politburo, made an emergency trip to Kunming, visiting the train station and wounded victims in hospital. The attack marked a major escalation in the simmering unrest that had centered on Xinjiang, a heavily Muslim region in China's far west strategically located on the borders of Central Asia. It is the first time people from Xinjiang have been blamed for carrying out such a large-scale attack so far from their homeland, and follows a smaller incident in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in October that shook the Communist Party leadership. China stepped up security in Xinjiang after a vehicle ploughed into tourists on the edge of Tiananmen Square, killing the three people in the car and two bystanders. China labeled it a suicide attack by militants from Xinjiang. Energy-rich Xinjiang, home to the Muslim Uighur people, many of whom chafe at Chinese restrictions on their culture and religion, borders ex-Soviet Central Asia, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, is hundreds of miles from Xinjiang and has little connection to the violence there that has killed more than 100 people in the past year. \"China must handle the incident transparently and not let it become a new political excuse to oppress Uighurs,\" Dilxat Raxit, a spokesman for the main Uighur exile group, the World Uyghur Congress, said in an emailed statement. \"Serious discrimination and oppressive policies lead to psychological trauma that could provoke victims to adopt extreme measures,\" he said, adding that there were \"no reasonable grounds\" for the attack. China bristles at suggestions from exiles and rights groups that the unrest is driven more by unhappiness at government policies than by any serious threat from extremist groups who want to establish an independent state called East Turkestan. One senior member of an advisory body to the parliament said such attacks in China had foreign links. \"The well-planned attack was not an issue of (ethnicity) or religion, it was an issue of terrorism with links to the terrorist forces out of the country,\" Xinhua quoted PLA Navy Rear Admiral Yin Zhuo as saying.", "label": {"what": ["Witnesses to chilling violence at a Chinese train

{"text": "It said evidence from the scene of the attack late Saturday in Kunming by a group of knife-wielding people pointed to separatists from Xinjiang, a vast region home to the mostly-Muslim Uighur minority. Victims described attackers dressed in black bursting into the station in the southwestern province of Yunnan and slashing indiscriminately. The attack left at least 29 dead and more than 130 wounded, Xinhua said, citing local authorities. Police shot dead at least four attackers, it said in an earlier report. Xinjiang is periodically hit by violent clashes between locals and security forces but such attacks are rare elsewhere in China. Beijing maintains that unrest in Xinjiang is caused by terrorist groups seeking an independent state, an account denied by Uighur rights groups who complain of widespread religious repression and economic discrimination. President Xi Jinping called for \"all-out efforts\" in the investigation and for the attackers to be punished \"in accordance with the law\", Xinhua said. Beijing's top security official Meng Jianzhu arrived in Kunming early Sunday and visited the scene of the attack, which came days before the opening of the annual session of the legislature, the National People's Congress, Xinhua reported. A knife victim named Yang Haifei, who was wounded in the chest and back, told Xinhua that he had been buying a train ticket when the attackers approached. \"I saw a person come straight at me with a long knife and I ran away with everyone,\" he said, while others \"simply fell on the ground\". Some who managed to escape were desperately looking for missing loved ones. \"I can't find my husband, and his phone went unanswered,\" Yang Ziqing was quoted as saying. She said she had been waiting for her train to Shanghai \"when a knife-wielding man suddenly came at them\". Officers sealed off a wide area around the station, it added, while Xinhua said police were questioning people at the site. The attackers were dressed in similar black clothing, the official China News Service said, citing witnesses. \"A group of men carrying weapons burst into the train station plaza and the ticket hall, stabbing whoever they saw,\" it said. State broadcaster CCTV called the incident a \"terrorist attack\" on its Weibo account. President Xi and Premier Li Keqiang sent condolences to the victims and their families. Photos posted on Sina Weibo showed blood spattered across the station floor and medical staff crouching over bodies lying on the ground, although the authenticity of the images could not be verified. The photos showed crowds gathered outside among police officers and ambulances. The injured had been delivered to hospitals around the city, local television station K6 said. A Weibo user going by the name HuangY3xin-Dione who was at a restaurant near the scene told how she saw a group of men in black with two long knives chasing people, Xinhua reported. Another eyewitness told the Beijing News that she had seen two women in black walking towards the station and that some of the attackers had their faces covered. Incidents involving Uighurs are often labelled \"terrorist attacks\" while others carried out by Chinese seen as having grievances against society or the authorities are not. In a high-profile incident in Beijing last October, three Uighur family members set their car on fire at Tiananmen Square, the symbolic heart of the Chinese state, killing themselves and two bystanders.", "label": {"what": ["It said evidence from the scene of the attack late Saturday in Kunming by a group of knife-wielding people pointed to separatists from Xinjiang", "Victims described attackers dressed in black bursting into the station in the southwestern province of Yunnan and slashing indiscriminately", "Xinjiang is periodically hit by violent clashes", "he had been buying a train ticket when the attackers approached", "a person come straight at me with a long knife", "she had been waiting for her train to Shanghai 'when a knife-wielding man suddenly came at them", "crowds gathered outside among police officers and ambulances"], "when": ["late Saturday", "earlier", "early Sunday", "before the opening of the annual session", "last October"], "where": ["from the scene of the attack", "in Kunming", "a vast region", "into the station", "in the southwestern province of Yunnan", "in an earlier report", "elsewhere in China", "Beijing", "in Xinjiang", "in Kunming", "in the chest and back", "on the ground", "to Shanghai", "a wide area around the station", "at the site", "into the train station plaza and the ticket hall", "on its Weibo account", "on Sina Weibo", "across the station floor", "on the ground", "outside among police officers and ambulances", "hospitals around the city", "at a restaurant near the scene", "In a high-profile incident", "in Beijing", "at Tiananmen Square"], "why": ["evidence from the scene of the attack", "violent clashes between locals and security forces", "terrorist groups seeking an independent state", "complain of widespread religious repression and economic discrimination", "looking for missing loved ones", "for her train to Shanghai", "Photos posted on Sina Weibo", "The photos", "others carried out by Chinese"], "who": ["the mostly-Muslim Uighur minority", "Victims", "Xinhua", "local authorities", "Police", "locals and security forces", "President Xi Jinping", "Beijing's top security official Meng Jianzhu", "A knife victim named Yang Haifei", "Some who managed to escape", "Yang Ziqing", "State broadcaster CCTV", "the official China News Service", "witnesses", "President Xi and Premier Li Keqiang", "condolences", "their families", "medical staff", "The injured", "local television station K6", "A Weibo user going by the name HuangY3xin-Dione", "Another eyewitness", "the Beijing News", "two bystanders"], "how": ["bursting into the station in the southwestern province of Yunnan and slashing indiscriminately", "such attacks are rare elsewhere in China", "The attackers were dressed in similar black clothing", "carrying weapons burst into the train station plaza and the ticket hall, stabbing whoever they saw", "a group of men in black with two long knives chasing people", "two women in black walking towards the station", "had their faces covered", "set their car on fire"], "damages": ["at least 29 dead and more than 130 wounded", "blood spattered across the station floor", "killing themselves and two bystanders"], "countermeasures": ["shot dead at least four attackers", "called for 'all-out efforts' in the investigation", "for the attackers to be punished 'in accordance with the law'", "arrived in Kunming", "visited the scene of the attack", "Officers sealed off a wide area around the station", "police were questioning people at the site", "sent condolences to the victims and their families", "medical staff crouching over bodies lying on the ground", "The injured had been delivered to hospitals around the city"], "perpetrators": ["a group of knife-wielding people", "separatists from Xinjiang", "attackers dressed in black", "four attackers", "terrorist groups", "Uighur rights groups", "a knife-wielding man", "'A group of men", "a group of men in black with two long knives", "two women in black", "some of the attackers", "three Uighur family members"]}}
{"text": "China's president, Xi Jinping, has called for \"all-out efforts\" to bring to justice the black-clad assailants who killed 29 people with knives and machetes in a bloody terrorist attack in the south-western city of Kunming on Saturday night. Officials blamed Xinjiang separatists for the frenzied violence at a crowded train station. Witnesses described fleeing in fear as the assailants hacked at people apparently at random. Graphic photographs of the aftermath showed bodies lying in pools of blood. One of the 130 survivors injured in the incident described fleeing in terror as a man lashed out with a long knife, nicking his scalp. \"I was terrified  and   they attacked us like crazy swordsmen, and mostly they went for the head and the shoulders, those parts of the body to kill,\" 20-year-old student Wu Yuheng told Reuters as he lay on a bed in a corridor of the Kunming Number One People's hospital. Xi urged security officials to \"severely punish in accordance with the law the violent terrorists and resolutely crack down on those who have been swollen with arrogance,\" state news agency Xinhua said. He added: \"Understand the serious and complex nature of combating terrorism  and   Go all out to maintain social stability.\" It is the first time people from the north-western region have been accused of such a major and organised attack outside its borders, despite rising unrest there in recent years. Many of its Uighur ethnic group, who are Muslim and Turkic-speaking, chafe at Chinese policies and a smaller number want an independent state. A doctor at the hospital described a scene of bedlam as scores of the seriously injured arrived. He told the Guardian the attackers appeared to be well trained because many of the cuts directly targeted internal organs. He said police were stationed in patients' rooms and doctors had been shown a notice ordering them not to divulge information on the injured, including their condition and how many there were. They were told to tell families the government would arrange compensation. They were also told that police had set up checkpoints on every route out of the city to ensure suspects could not leave. Armed police patrolled the tense city on Sunday night as officers continued their hunt for five of the 10 assailants. They shot four attackers dead at the scene, three men and one woman, and captured a female suspect, Xinhua reported. Evidence at the scene of the \"organised, premeditated violent terrorist attack\" showed separatists were responsible, it said, citing the Kunming government. Magnus Ranstorp, a counter-terrorism expert at the Swedish National Defence College, noted that little information was available at present but said that if Uighurs were responsible, \"it is without question an escalation  and   There hasn't been anything on this scale, as far as I have seen.\" The authorities have consistently blamed outbreaks of violence on a small number of separatists seeking an independent Xinjiang, working with the support or at the instigation of people outside the country. They reject suggestions that the unrest is fuelled by discontent at government policies rather than by an organised terrorist network. On Sunday night, 24 hours after the violence, people gathered at a vigil outside the station, where candles in cups had been laid out to form a heart shape and the date of the attack. One man in the crowd told his friends: \"If I had come here two hours earlier, I would have been part of this.\" Close by, luggage dropped by people as they fled had been piled up on the area outside the station, apparently tagged as evidence. The heavy security presence included plainclothes officers with earpieces as well as police with machine guns and on motorbikes. Police vehicles lined the road. AP reported police were rounding up members of the city's small Uighur community, thought to number at most several dozen, for questioning about the attack. \"How do we know them?\" said a Uighur man who gave only his first name, Akpar. \"We could not tell if the assailants were Uighurs as they were all dressed in black. We did not like the attack either.\" Mr Zhang, a businessman who was in Kunming for work, told the Guardian he was at a nearby hotel when a woman ran out of the station waiting area screaming that a crazy person was stabbing people. \"Then people began to scatter, running in all directions   over 100 people,\" he said. \"A man was stabbed and fell down and got up again.\" Sixteen-year-old student Qiao Yunao told Associated Press she saw people crying out and running before an attacker cut a man's neck. \"I was freaking out, and ran to a fast food store, and many people were running in there to take refuge,\" she said via the Sina Weibo microblog. \"I saw two attackers, both men, one with a watermelon knife and the other with a fruit knife. They were running and chopping whoever they could.\" Mr Wang, who works at a convenience store close to the station, said he saw police chasing a crowd of people to the street corner. \"I heard gunshots and saw a man collapse. I couldn't watch after that. The police rounded up people and put them on a bus.\" Security in Beijing had already been tightened because the annual session of China's largely rubber-stamp parliament opens in the capital on Wednesday, with another political meeting taking place on Monday. Officials have been particularly anxious about the safety of the capital since a car ploughed into tourists in Tiananmen Square, its political heart, last October. Two pedestrians, the driver and two passengers died in an incident also blamed on extremists from Xinjiang. At least 100 people have died in outbreaks of violence in the region in the last year. Last month, police killed eight people they said had attacked patrol cars in Xinjiang. In 2009, almost 200 died in vicious ethnic riots in its capital, rmqi. Many in the region's Uighur ethnic minority chafe at Han Chinese migration and controls on their religion and culture, which they believe are eroding their way of life. But Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, is hundreds of miles from Xinjiang. In July 2008, just before the Olympics, a Uighur separatist group claimed responsibility for two bus explosions in the city, but officials said there was no evidence of terrorism. A commentary on the English website of the state newspaper Global Times described the attack as \"China's 9/11\", saying: \"The latest attacks in Beijing and Kunming have clearly indicated a despicable trend that separatists are targeting civilians out of Xinjiang. \"It also showed a shift in their attack strategies from targeting symbols of the government, such as public security stations and police vehicles, to roadside civilians.\" Xinhua quoted navy rear-admiral Yin Zhuo as saying: \"The well planned attack was not an issue of [ethnicity] or religion, it was an issue of terrorism with links to terrorist forces out of the country.\" Authorities have yet to reveal the identities of those captured, shot dead or on the run, or give evidence of their motivation.\"They are holding that back and I think they are doing that because of the danger of stoking Han nationalism and resentment.

{"text": "The United Nations Security Council has condemned as a terrorist attack the slashing rampage Saturday night in a train station in the southwestern city of Kunming, in which a group of black-clad assailants with knives and daggers killed at least 29 people and wounded 143. Hong Kong news outlets said about 75 of those may be severely injured. Apparently seeking to contain domestic anger against Uighurs X the Turkic-speaking, mostly Muslim ethnic group from the western region of Xinjiang whom Chinese officials blame for the attack X and to censure some Western news media for not immediately describing the killings as terrorism, Xinhua, the state news agency, ran the United Nations statement prominently on the Chinese-language version of its website, along with comments from other governments and leaders, notably that of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Heres how The New York Times described the scene in Kunming: The group of about 10 attackers, dressed in black and wearing cloth masks, arrived in front of Kunming Railway Station in southwest China on Saturday night and began slashing at employees and commuters, sometimes repeatedly plunging their long knives and daggers into people too stunned or slow to flee. By the time the police shot dead four assailants and ended the slaughter, the square and ticket sales hall at the station were strewn with bodies and moaning survivors in pools of blood. At the same time, Chinese censors are deleting from social media many comments or images that they consider unhelpful to their management of the situation, or that challenge the official narrative. Items deleted from Sina Weibo, the popular microblogging service, include: Photos of what some Weibo users said was the shirt worn by the attackers: black with the crescent moon and star of Islam in its top left. Chen Qiyu, the editor of the Fujian Today newspaper, wrote: If anyone sees this black shirt in public, please call the police and make a quick escape. Similar posts labeled Photo of what the Kunming terrorists wore were also deleted.\nBloody photos of people on the ground outside the station. (Many news outlets used drawings instead of photographs.)\nQuestions from ordinary Chinese wondering about the background of the event. This comment from Fu Zhibin, a Beijing resident with more than 45,000 followers on Sina Weibo, was deleted: After dealing with Xinjiang for over 60 years, the result is bringing disaster to the entire country. Can you let us all know the internal situation and let us participate in the discussion about Xinjiangs future. If you cant handle things, then dont cover them up. The statement by the United Nations Security Council, issued late Sunday, was unequivocal: The members of the Security Council condemned in the strongest terms the terrorist attack on 1 March 2014 in Kunming Train Station, China, which has caused numerous deaths and injuries of innocent civilians. The members of the Security Council extended their deepest sympathy and condolence to the victims and their families suffered from such most heinous terrorist attack, as well as to the people and the government of the Peoples Republic of China. Western hypocrisy was another target of ire in some state news outlets. Completely hypocritical and callous, ran the headline of an opinion piece in Peoples Daily, the main newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, under the byline of Wen Xian, a possible pseudonym. It accused Western media of soft-pedaling the attack and failing to state clearly that it was an act of terrorism. This violent attack shows the fundamentally anti-humane, anti-civilized, anti-social nature of the attackers, wrote Wen Xian. They are out-and-out terrorists. But some Western media, including CNN, The Associated Press, The New York Times and The Washington Post, were mystifying, confusing, even to the point of sowing discord. These media are always the loudest when it comes to anti-terrorism, but in the Kunming train station terrorist violence they lost their voice and spoke confusedly, making people angry. China is eager to ensure that the world recognizes the attack as terrorism and does not merely blame the Chinese government for what many critics call its repressive policies in Xinjiang. Further complicating matters, leaders must keep on course one of the most important political events of the year, as the Chinese Peoples Political Consultative Conference and the National Peoples Congress meet in Beijing this week. The front page of The Beijing News mentioned the carnage in a headline that quoted President Xi Jinpings instruction on how to handle the incident. But below the headline was a photograph not of the attack scene, but of two star athletes who are delegates to the Chinese Peoples Political Consultative Conference: Yao Ming, the former basketball player, and Liu Xiang, the hurdler. One Sina Weibo user named Kang Shaojian, in a deleted post, remarked: Theres no Kunming in The Beijing News or Beijing Times. For such a major case that could influence history, there are no responsible media to say anything. Yes, the media have been throttled. Every one of us is experiencing the horror, and we dont even know the reasons for the fear and anger. How can we hope that we will be safe? The meetings themselves are contributing to the tension in the capital, with speculation rampant among many well-informed Chinese that a public announcement may be made on the fate of Zhou Yongkang, the former head of the countrys powerful security services who has been under investigation over corruption allegations. Criticisms of security forces were also quickly deleted. In a deleted blog post from Australia showing what appeared to be a victim of the attack X a dead man next to a suitcase X Qiu Yueshou raised questions about security in Kunming, noting that many local senior Communist Party members were already in Beijing for the national meetings. Where did the Communist Party members go? he asked five times.", "label": {"what": ["The United Nations Security Council has condemned as a terrorist attack the slashing rampage Saturday night in a train station in the southwestern city of Kunming", "a group of black-clad assailants with knives and daggers killed at least 29 people and wounded 143", "to censure some Western news media for not immediately describing the killings as terrorism", "Apparently seeking to contain domestic anger against Uighurs X the Turkic-speaking, mostly Muslim ethnic group from the western region of Xinjiang whom Chinese officials blame for the attack X and to censure some Western news media for not immediately describing the killings as terrorism, Xinhua, the state news agency, ran the United Nations statement prominently on the Chinese-language version of its website, along with comments from other governments and leaders, notably that of President Vladimir V.

{"text": "BEIJINGXA mass knife attack at a train station that left 33 dead over the weekend signaled Chinese authorities are facing a significant escalation of a long-simmering separatist movement. Saturday's assault marked the second time in a little over four months that Chinese authorities say separatists from the Xinjiang regionXwhich borders Pakistan, Afghanistan and former Soviet Central AsiaXhave carried out a relatively complex and carefully planned attack outside their home territory. At least 10 assailants armed with long knives and dressed in black stormed through a crowded train station Saturday night in the southwestern city of Kunming, slashing people at random, according to state media. Police shot and killed four assailants, arrested one, and were searching for five others, state media said. Thirty-three died, including the attackers, and at least 130 were injured. It was the deadliest attack ever attributed to Xinjiang separatists outside their home territory and marks a departure in tactics.\nTargets in the past have usually been police, paramilitary barracks and other symbols of Chinese government authority, and attacks have mainly been staged inside Xinjiang. The scale and relative sophistication of the Kunming attack poses a test for President Xi Jinping and the new commission he established to improve coordination among security agencies, which often have conflicting agendas and compete for resources, according to Chinese security analysts. \"This attack in Kunming was not something that could have been planned in one or two months,\" said Li Wei, director of the Center for Counter-Terrorism Studies at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations. \"I think it would need more like six months,\" he said. \"It's clear that separatist forces are trying to expand their activities in China and trying to create ethnic tensions.\" The Kunming attack came even as security was heightened nationwide in preparation for the annual meeting of the National People's Congress, China's legislature. The congress, widely seen as the highlight of China's political calendar, was set to begin Wednesday in Beijing. In a previous attack outside Xinjiang, authorities said three separatists set their vehicle ablaze in central Beijing's Tiananmen Square in October, killing themselves and two tourists. Before that, almost all of the violence attributed to Xinjiang separatists had been confined to Xinjiang, where some members of the mostly Muslim Uighur ethnic group have been resisting Chinese rule for decades. The vast majority of the unrest has involved young Uighur men attacking police stations and other government sites, usually with knives or crude fire bombs, in seemingly uncoordinated or poorly planned attacks. China has long blamed such violence on separatist groups with links to al Qaeda. Uighur activists overseas have denied that, blaming the violence instead on restrictions on religious practice and resentment over mass immigration of ethnic Han Chinese. On Sunday, order had been mostly restored in Kunming. Security forces, some heavily armed, patrolled the train station, which reopened Sunday morning. A makeshift memorial of candles was arranged in a heart shape around the numerals 3-01, for the March 1 date of the attack. The attacks in Beijing and KunmingXalthough still relatively crude, without firearms or explosivesXsuggest that some separatists are becoming more radical and better-organized, according to Mr. Li and other Chinese experts on security and Xinjiang. Reports that the attackers all wore black suggested that they were organized and trying to maximize psychological impact, said Mr. Li. The reported involvement of women in the Beijing and Kunming attacks also showed that separatist groups were no longer only recruiting men, he said. Pan Zhiping, head of the Institute of Central Asia at the Xinjiang Academy of Social Sciences, said Xinjiang separatists were imitating the tactics of Chechen militants who have been blamed for multiple attacks in Moscow and other Russian cities. Other experts suggested that separatists were targeting areas outside Xinjiang because attacks within the region had little political impact and security measures were much weaker in other areas. Most Chinese train stations have X-ray machines at entrances, but Zheng Liang, a professor at Xinjiang University, suggested the checks at Kunming station were insufficient. \"How come the X-ray machines couldn't identify the choppers and knives?\" he said. In accounts in state media, witnesses described the assailants working their way through the ticketing hall, and chasing people who ran into shops and out onto the plaza outside the station. One witness who had been at a hotel nearby said he saw men and two women dressed in black slashing and stabbing at people as they ran. After police closed in, at first everybody hit the ground and then \"everyone ran. There were knives everywhere and they began throwing them at people,\" he said. \"They have achieved their targetXterrifying ordinary citizens and shocking the world,\" said Mr. Zheng, the professor. \"By doing so I think they hope to obtain financial and other support from international terrorist organizations. China has often accused Uighur groups in the U.S. and Europe of helping to organize violence inside China. The World Uyghur Congress, an advocacy group which has offices in Germany and the U.S., denied any involvement in the Kunming attack and said there was no justification for attacks on civilians. \"China must be transparent in handling this matter and not let it become an excuse for repression, for seriously discriminatory and repressive policies that could lead to psychological trauma and possibly excite the victims to take extreme measures,\" said Dilxat Raxit, a spokesman for the group. He linked the spread of violence beyond Xinjiang to the discrimination suffered by many Uighurs who had migrated to other parts of China in search of work in recent years. Uighur activists say Chinese authorities have stepped up harassment and detention of Uighurs in Xinjiang and other areas since the Beijing attack. Last month, Xinjiang authorities formally arrested Ilham Tohti, a Uighur and dissident scholar, on charges of fomenting separatism. His lawyer denied the charges. Some security experts said the Chinese government needed to find new ways to approach the problem, other than pouring money into Xinjiang for economic development while stifling criticism of government policies. Some said China needs to strengthen counterterrorism cooperation with other countries, especially Pakistan and Afghanistan given the imminent withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan. Others said Beijing needed to focus on protecting local customs and strengthening the rule of law. President Xi, who became head of the new National Security Commission in January, responded to the Kunming attack by dispatching two of his top security officials to the city, and calling for the attackers to be brought to justice. The only details made public so far are that the group is headed by Mr. Xi, with Premier Li Keqiang and parliament chief Zhang Dejiang as his deputies, and it reports to the party's PolitburoXits top 25 leaders. \"One thing regarding the NSC is how to coordinate work among different bodiesXthe army, the intelligence agencies and the police,\" said Mr. Zheng of Xinjiang University. \"Can they share information with each other?\"", "label": {"what": ["BEIJINGXA mass knife attack at a train station", "Chinese authorities are facing a significant escalation of a long-simmering separatist movement",

{"text": "A French Ministry of Defense official tells Fox News that the Air Algerie jet carrying 116 people that vanished from radar shortly after takeoff late Wednesday night has crashed in Mali, and that two French fighter jets have located the wreckage. Air navigation services lost track of the Swiftair MD-83 roughly 50 minutes after takeoff from Ougadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso, at 9:55 p.m. ET Wednesday, the official Algerian news agency said. France's foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, told The Associated Press that the flight \"probably crashed.\" The French Ministry of Defense official told Fox News that the plane went down near the Malian city of Gao, a city essentially under the control of the Malian government, though it has seen lingering separatist violence. The list of passengers includes 51 French, 27 Burkina Faso nationals, eight Lebanese, six Algerians, five Canadians, four Germans, two Luxemburg nationals, one Swiss, one Belgium, one Egyptian, one Ukrainian, one Nigerian, one Cameroonian and one Malian, Burkina Faso Transport Minister Jean Bertin Ouedraogo said. The six crew members are Spanish, according to the Spanish pilots' union. Swiftair, a private Spanish airline, said the plane departed Burkina Faso for Algiers at 9:17 p.m. ET Wednesday, but had not arrived at the scheduled time of 1:10 a.m. ET Thursday. Swiftair said it was unable to make contact with the plane. \"In keeping with procedures, Air Algerie has launched its emergency plan,\" the APS news agency quoted the airline as saying. Burkina Faso authorities also set up a crisis unit in Ouagadougou airport to update families of people on board the plane, Reuters reports. The flight path of the plane from Ouagadougou, the capital of the west African nation of Burkina Faso, to Algiers wasn't immediately clear. Ougadougou is in a nearly straight line south of Algiers, passing over Mali where unrest continues in the north. The plane sent its last message around 9:30 p.m. ET, asking Niger air control to change its route because of heavy rains in the area, Ouedraogo said. A source also told Sky News that the plane asked to divert its path to avoid another aircraft. Algerian Prime Minister Abdelmalek Sellal said on Algerian state television that 10 minutes before disappearing, the pilots were in contact with air traffic controllers in Gao. Last week, an armed Islamist group formed by Al Qaeda commander Mokhtar Belmokhtar reportedly claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing that killed a French soldier in northern Mali. In a video posted on the Internet, a spokesman for the group Al-Mourabitoun, identifying himself as Abu Assem Al-Muhajir, said the attack north of Gao, was \"a response to French claims that they had annihilated the Mujahideen (Islamic fighters)\". Al-Mourabitoun was formed last year from the fusion of two Islamist groups operating in northern Mali: the Mulathameen brigade, led by the one-eyed Belmokhtar who is thought to have masterminded an attack on an Algerian gas plant last year in which nearly 40 hostages were killed, and the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa (MUJWA), Reuters reports. A senior French official told The Associated Press that it seems unlikely that these fighters had the kind of weaponry that could shoot down a plane. The official, not authorized to speak publicly, said on condition of anonymity that they primarily have shoulder-fired weapons -- not enough to hit a passenger plane flying at cruising altitude. Swiftair took ownership of the plane on Oct. 24, 2012, after it spent nearly 10 months unused in storage, according to Flightglobal's Ascend Online Fleets, which sells and tracks information about aircraft. It has more than 37,800 hours of flight time and has made more than 32,100 takeoffs and landings. The plane has had several owners over the years, including Avianca and Austral Lineas Aereas. The MD-83 is part of a series of jets built since the early 1980s by McDonnell Douglas, a U.S. plane maker now owned by Boeing Co. The MD-80s are single-aisle planes that were a workhorse of the airline industry for short and medium-range flights for nearly two decades. As jet fuel prices spiked in recent years, airlines have rapidly being replacing the jets with newer, fuel-efficient models such as Boeing 737s and Airbus A320s. There are 496 other MD-80s being flown by airlines around the world, according to Ascend. \"We're aware of reports on Air Algerie Flight AH5017,\" Boeing spokesman Wilson Chow said. \"Our team is gathering more information.\"", "label": {"what": ["the Air Algerie jet carrying 116 people that vanished from radar", "has crashed", "Air navigation services lost track of the Swiftair MD-83", "the plane departed Burkina Faso for Algiers", "had not arrived at the scheduled time", "The flight path of the plane from Ouagadougou, the capital of the west African nation of Burkina Faso, to Algiers wasn't immediately clear", "The plane sent its last message around 9:30 p.m. ET", "the plane asked to divert its path", "Swiftair took ownership of the plane"], "when": ["late Wednesday night", "roughly 50 minutes after takeoff", "at 9:55 p.m. ET Wednesday", "at 9:17 p.m. ET Wednesday", "1:10 a.m. ET Thursday", "around 9:30 p.m. ET", "10 minutes before disappearing", "on Oct. 24, 2012, after it spent nearly 10 months unused in storage"], "where": ["in Mali", "from Ougadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso", "near the Malian city of Gao, a city essentially under the control of the Malian government", "from Ouagadougou, the capital of the west African nation of Burkina Faso, to Algiers", "on Algerian state television", "in Gao"], "why": ["to avoid another aircraft", "heavy rains in the area", "not enough to hit a passenger plane flying at cruising altitude"], "who": ["A French Ministry of Defense official", "Fox News", "the Swiftair MD-83", "the official Algerian news agency", "France's foreign minister, Laurent Fabius", "The Associated Press", "The French Ministry of Defense official", "The list of passengers includes 51 French, 27 Burkina Faso nationals, eight Lebanese, six Algerians, five Canadians, four Germans, two Luxemburg nationals, one Swiss, one Belgium, one Egyptian, one Ukrainian, one Nigerian, one Cameroonian and one Malian", "Burkina Faso Transport Minister Jean Bertin Ouedraogo", "the Spanish pilots' union.

Among the passengers, he said, were 50 people from France; 24 from Burkina Faso; eight Lebanese; six Algerians; five Canadians; four Germans; two from Luxembourg; one from Mali; one Cameroonian; one Belgian; one Ukrainian; one Romanian; one Swiss; one Nigerian; and one Egyptian. The plane's six crew members were Spanish, Houaoui said. The plane belongs to a private Spanish company, Swiftair, but it appears to have been operated by Air Algerie. A U.S. State Department official said the department was not aware of any Americans on the flight. Ouagadougou Airport said in a statement that Mariela Castro, daughter of Cuban President Raul Castro, was among those on board. However, the National Center for Sexual Education in Havana, Cuba, which Mariela Castro runs, denied the reports and told CNN she was at an event in Havana. Castro subsequently told a Telesur anchor who interviewed her by phone, \"I'm alive, kicking, happy and healthy!\" Weather may have played a role in crash According to CNN meteorologist Mari Ramos, the flight path took the aircraft through a region of thunderstorms. The flight path went through a turbulent area, so it is likely that if the plane was diverted because of weather, it was to avoid a bumpy flight. Thunderstorms are a very common occurrence at this time of year in the area. The MD-83 is part of the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 family of twin-engine, single-aisle jets. Air Algerie is Algeria's national airline, with flights to 28 countries. The deadliest incident in the airline's history occurred in March 2003 when a domestic flight crashed after takeoff, killing 102 people on board. One person survived. In February, a Hercules C-130 military aircraft crashed in the mountains of eastern Algeria, killing 77 of the 78 people on board.

{"text": "Quebecs Burkinab community is coming together to support the families of Burkina Faso immigrants who were aboard Air Algerie Flight AH5017 when it crashed on Thursday. Five Canadians and several Canadian permanent residents, all from Quebec, were among the 118 people on the plane, which was flying from Burkina Faso's capital of Ouagadougou to Algiers when it went down over northern Mail. According to the Burkinab Association of Greater Montreal, 11 members of Quebec's Burkina Faso community  six adults and five children  were on board. Association president Mahamadi Savadogo said his community is doing what it can to help support those affected. \"We put in a crisis unit to support the families,\" he told CBC's Daybreak. The association has also set up a fund to raise money for the families and is organizing a candlelight vigil tonight at 8:30 p.m. ET at Marie-Victorin Park in Longueuil. Passengers from Longueuil, Sherbrooke Four of the five Canadians on board Air Algerie Flight AH5017 were members of a Longueuil family: Winmalo Somda, his wife, Angelique Kpoda, and their children, Arielle and Nathanael. Winmalo's brother, Wilfried Somda, was also on the plane. The family members were on their way back to Montreal after attending a wedding in Burkina Faso. Wilfried Somda's pregnant wife and their three-year-old daughter stayed behind in Longueuil. \"Something that is important to have in this situation is to have a human presence and morally support them,\" Savadogo said. Isabelle Prvost, of Sherbrooke, Que., was also travelling with the Somda family. Her partner, Danny Frappier, said Prvost was on vacation. She is survived by three children, aged five, seven and nine. Mamadou Zoungrana, a permanent resident who lived in Gatineau, lost his wife and children. Zoungrana and his family had been living apart for the past two years. His wife, Salimata, and sons, Brice, 6. and Arsne, 13, were supposed to land in Montreal this week, to join Zoungrana for a new life in Canada. Jonquire man loses Canada-bound wife and son Bassirou Yameogo, who lives in Jonquire near Saguenay, lost his wife, Kadidia Koanda, and 15-year-old son, Aboubacar. A teacher back in Burkina Faso, Yameogo came to Canada in 2012 to establish himself before sending for his wife and son to join him. \"I hadn't seen them for 29 months. I came here to give them a better life. Now they'll never see Canada, never know that life, and I'll never see them again,\" he told CBC News. Yameogo said that he spoke to his wife and son before they boarded the Algiers-bound flight and set his alarm for 2:30 a.m. to talk to them once they landed in Algeria. He said he began to worry when there was still no word from them by 5 a.m. That's when his younger brother called him from Burkina Faso to tell him of local reports that the plane was missing. \"I think about how they suffered before they died, how my son cried for his mother, and how she might have cried for him,\" he said. Yameogo's son was registered to start high school in Jonquire in September. Mother coming to meet her new grandson Quebec City resident Moise Sandwidi lost his mother Martone Sandwidi on Flight AH5017. The 57-year-old wife and mother of five was embarking on her first trip to Canada to visit Moise, who moved to Quebec in 2005 as a student and now works for the province's health insurance board.

{"text": "French soldiers combing a field of debris in a desolate region of northwest African country of Mali Friday recovered the black box from an Air Algerie plane that crashed, killing all 118 aboard. Terrorism hasn't been ruled out as a cause, but officials say bad weather most likely brought the jetliner down, after it disappeared from radar less than an hour after it took off early Thursday from Burkina Faso's capital, Ouagadougou, for Algiers. Soldiers from France and the neighboring West African country of Burkina Faso dispatched to identify the planes wreckage had trouble finding evidence in a concentrated area in the Gossi region of Mali. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius described the area to reporters Friday as a zone of savannah and sand with very difficult access, especially in this rainy season.\" A French Reaper drone based in Niger spotted the wreckage after getting alerts from Burkina Faso and Malian soldiers, Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told reporters. Officials in Burkina Faso later said human remains and the burnt wreckage had been found about 30 miles from the border of Burkina Faso near the Malian village of Boulikessi. Burkina Faso soldiers were reportedly the first to reach the site. The country's prime minister, Luc Adolphe Tiao, reviewed videos of the wreckage site and said identifying the victims will be challenging. \"It will be difficult to reconstitute the bodies of the victims,\" Tiao said at a news conference. \"The human remains are so scattered.\" More than 200 troops are guarding the site before French accident and criminal investigators arrive Saturday, Fabius said at a news conference in Paris with the defense and transport ministers. \"We think the plane went down due to weather conditions, but no hypothesis can be excluded as long as we don't have the results of an investigation,\" Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve told RTL radio hours before the news conference with three other government ministers. \"There are hypotheses, notably weather-related, but we don't rule out anything because we want to know what happened,\" French President Francois Hollande said. \"What we know is that the debris is concentrated in a limited space, but it is too soon to draw conclusions.\" There have been conflicting reports on the crash death toll. French government officials, including Hollande and Fabius, revised it to 118, without explaining the reason for the change. They also raised the number of French killed to 54 from 51. Air Algerie and private Spanish airline Swiftair, which was operating Flight 5017, said Thursday there were 116 people onboard. A list of passengers reported Thursday included 51 French, 27 Burkina Faso nationals, eight Lebanese, six Algerians, five Canadians, four Germans, two Luxemburg nationals, one Swiss, one Belgium, one Egyptian, one Ukrainian, one Nigerian, one Cameroonian and one Malian, Burkina Faso Transport Minister Jean Bertin Ouedraogo said. The six crew members are Spanish, according to the Spanish pilots' union. French television showed images of the wreckage site taken by a soldier from Burkina Faso. The brief footage showed a desolate area with scattered debris that was unrecognizable. There were bits of twisted metal but no identifiable parts such as the fuselage or tail, or victims' bodies. Scrubby vegetation could be seen scattered in the background. One of two black boxes has been found and was sent to Gao, a troubled city in northern Mali where remains will be sent for identification before being repatriated, Fabius said at Friday's news conference.  The Gossi region where the accident occurred, near the Burkina Faso border, is 100 miles south of Gao. The plane sent its last message around 9:30 p.m. ET, asking Niger air control to change its route because of heavy rains in the area, Ouedraogo said. A source also told Sky News that the plane asked to divert its path to avoid another aircraft. Algerian Prime Minister Abdelmalek Sellal said on Algerian state television that 10 minutes before disappearing, the pilots were in contact with air traffic controllers in Gao. The flight path of the plane from Ouagadougou, the capital of the west African nation of Burkina Faso, to Algiers wasn't immediately clear. Ougadougou is in a nearly straight line south of Algiers, passing over Mali where unrest continues in the north. Investigators will look at all possible causes for the crash, including terrorism. \"Terrorist groups are in the zone. ... We know these groups are hostile to Western interests.\" French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve told RTL radio. A French contingent of troops is based in Gao, a government-controlled town. The vast deserts and mountains of northern Mali fell under control of ethnic Tuareg separatists and then Al Qaeda-linked Islamic extremists after a military coup in 2012. French forces intervened in January 2013 to rout Islamist extremists controlling the region. A French soldier was killed earlier this month near the town of Gao, where French troops remain. The intervention scattered the extremists, but the Tuaregs have pushed back against the authority of the Bamako-based government. Meanwhile, the threat from Islamic militants hasn't disappeared, and France is giving its troops a new and larger anti-terrorist mission across the region. A senior French official told The Associated Press that it seems unlikely that these fighters had the kind of weaponry that could shoot down a plane. The official, not authorized to speak publicly, said on condition of anonymity that they primarily have shoulder-fired weapons -- not enough to hit a passenger plane flying at cruising altitude. Nearly half of the victims were from France and the disaster has hit the country hard. \"I share the pain of families living through this terrible ordeal,\" Hollande said. Hollande has said that France will spare no efforts to uncover why the plane went down -- the third major plane disaster around the world within a week. A Malaysia Airlines flight was shot down last week over war-torn eastern Ukraine. The U.S. has blamed it on separatists firing a surface-to-air missile.

{"text": "French troops are headed to a remote area in Mali today to secure the site of Thursday's Air Algerie jet crash, the third major international aviation disaster in a week, after wreckage was found. French President Francois Hollande said there were no survivors in the crash of the MD-83 aircraft, which disappeared from radar less than an hour after takeoff early Thursday from Burkina Faso's capital, Ouagadougou, for Algiers. The plane had requested permission to change course because of bad weather. The jetliner - owned by Spanish company Swiftair and leased by Algeria's flagship carrier - had 110 passengers and six crew members on board. Speaking after a crisis meeting, Hollande also announced that one of the aircraft's two black boxes has been found in the wreckage, in the Gossi region near the border with Burkina Faso. It is being taken to the northern Mali city of Gao. A French Reaper drone based in Niger spotted the wreckage, French Transport Minister Frederic Cuvillier told France-Info radio today. Two helicopter teams also overflew, noting that the wreckage was in a concentrated area. A column of soldiers in about 30 vehicles were dispatched to the site, he said. A statement early today from Hollande's office said the aircraft had been clearly identified \"despite its state of disintegration.\" France's interior minister said today that terrorism cannot be excluded as a cause for the tragedy, though it was likely because of bad weather. French forces, stationed in Mali to help combat al Qaeda and tribal separatists, are tasked with securing the crash site and gathering information. Much of the region is desert, rugged and remote, with few roads and an average high temperature of 101 degrees this time of the year. More than 50 French passengers were aboard the plane, the airline said. Other passengers hailed from Burkina Faso, Lebanon, Canada, Algeria, Luxemburg, Switzerland, Nigeria, Cameroon and Malia. The six crew members were Spanish. News of the plane's disappearance came when Swiftair, the Spanish company that operated the plane, released a statement saying the plane had not arrived at its destination. Transport Minister Jean Bertin Ouedraogo said the plane sent its last message around 9:30 p.m. ET on Wednesday, asking Niger air control to change its route because of heavy rains in the area. John Hansman, MIT professor of aeronautics and astronautics, said sand storms can be especially problematic for flight crews. Sand storms are really bad because the sand is ingested in the engines, and it can create a problem, Hansman said. The flight path of Flight 5017 from Ouagadougou, the capital of the West African nation of Burkina Faso, to Algiers was not immediately clear. Ouagadougou is in a nearly straight line south of Algiers, passing over Mali. Northern Mali has been the scene of firefights between the alliance of al Qaeda affiliated fighters and Tuareg separatists against French troops supporting the Mali government. The crash of the Air Algerie plane is the latest in a series of aviation disasters. In March, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared over the southern Indian Ocean with 239 people on board. No wreckage from the plane has been found. Last week, a Malaysia Airlines jetliner was shot down over a war-torn section of Ukraine, with U.S. officials blaming it on separatists firing a surface-to-air missile. On Wednesday, a Taiwanese plane crashed during a storm, killing 48 people. While fliers are jittery about the tragedies, air travel remains relatively safe. There have been two deaths for every 100 million passengers on commercial flights in the last decade, excluding acts of terrorism. Travelers are much more likely to die driving to the airport than stepping on a plane. There are more than 30,000 motor-vehicle deaths in the U.S. each year, a mortality rate eight times greater than that in planes. Jetliners such as the one that crashed in Taiwan and Mali are designed to survive storms, but pilots are supposed to fly around bad weather, MITs professor Hansman said. Weather in and of itself shouldn't have been a problem in either of these accidents, he said, but its likely to be a combination of the weather and the pilots not being able to react to the weather.", "label": {"what": ["French troops are headed to a remote area", "the third major international aviation disaster", "The jetliner - owned by Spanish company Swiftair and leased by Algeria's flagship carrier - had 110 passengers and six crew members on board", "one of the aircraft's two black boxes has been found in the wreckage", "It is being taken to the northern Mali city of Gao", "A statement early today from Hollande's office said the aircraft had been clearly identified", "The flight path of Flight 5017 from Ouagadougou, the capital of the West African nation of Burkina Faso, to Algiers was not immediately clear", "The crash of the Air Algerie plane is the latest in a series of aviation disasters", "No wreckage from the plane has been found", "fliers are jittery about the tragedies", "air travel remains relatively safe"], "when": ["Thursday", "in a week", "after wreckage was found", "less than an hour after takeoff early Thursday", "early today", "this time of the year", "More than 50 French passengers were aboard the plane", "around 9:30 p.m. ET on Wednesday", "In March", "Last week", "On Wednesday", "in the last decade"], "where": ["a remote area in Mali", "the site of Thursday's Air Algerie jet crash", "from Burkina Faso's capital, Ouagadougou, for Algiers", "in the Gossi region near the border with Burkina Faso", "the northern Mali city of Gao", "in Niger", "in a concentrated area", "in Mali", "from Burkina Faso, Lebanon, Canada, Algeria, Luxemburg, Switzerland, Nigeria, Cameroon and Malia", "in the area", "the West African nation of Burkina Faso", "south of Algiers", "Northern Mali", "over the southern Indian Ocean", "over a war-torn section of Ukraine", "on commercial flights", "in the U.S.", "in Taiwan and Mali"], "why": ["the crash of the MD-83 aircraft", "because of bad weather", "terrorism cannot be excluded as a cause for the tragedy", "because of bad weather", "help combat al Qaeda and tribal separatists", "because of heavy rains", "sand storms can be especially problematic", "because the sand is ingested in the engines, and it can create a problem", "Northern Mali has been the scene of firefights between the alliance of al Qaeda affiliated fighters and Tuareg separatists against French troops supporting the Mali government", "supporting the Mali government", "separatists firing a surface-to-air missile", "a storm", "acts of terrorism", "more than 30,000 motor-vehicle deaths in the U.S. each year, a mortality rate eight times greater than that in planes", "a combination of the weather and the pilots not being able to react to the weather"], "who": ["French troops", "French President Francois Hollande", "110 passengers and six crew members", "French Transport Minister Frederic Cuvillier", "France-Info radio", "A column of soldiers", "Hollande's office", "France's interior minister", "French forces", "More than 50 French passengers", "the airline", "Other passengers", "The six crew members", "Swiftair, the Spanish company", "Transport Minister Jean Bertin Ouedraogo", "John Hansman, MIT professor of aeronautics and astronautics", "flight crews", "Flight 5017", "the alliance of al Qaeda affiliated fighters and Tuareg separatists ", "the Mali government", "Malaysia Airlines Flight 370", "239 people", "U.S. officials", "separatists", "48 people", "fliers", "100 million passengers", "Travelers", "pilots", "MITs professor Hansman"], "how": ["disappeared from radar less than an hour after takeoff early Thursday from Burkina Faso's capital, Ouagadougou, for Algiers", "A French Reaper drone based in Niger spotted the wreckage", "noting that the wreckage was in a concentrated area", "News of the plane's disappearance came when Swiftair, the Spanish company that operated the plane, released a statement saying the plane had not arrived at its destination", "the plane sent its last message around 9:30 p.m. ET on Wednesday, asking Niger air control to change its route"], "damages": ["no survivors", "its state of disintegration", "239 people on board", "Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared", "a Malaysia Airlines jetliner was shot down", "killing 48 people", "two deaths for every 100 million passengers", "more than 30,000 motor-vehicle deaths"], "countermeasures": ["secure the site of Thursday's Air Algerie jet crash", "The plane had requested permission to change course", "a crisis meeting", "Two helicopter teams also overflew", "A column of soldiers in about 30 vehicles were dispatched to the site", "tasked with securing the crash site and gathering information", "designed to survive storms"]}}
{"text": "An Algerian aircraft carrying 110 passengers and six crew crashed in northern Africa early on Thursday with the apparent death of all on board  the third airliner disaster in a week. Flight AH5017 operated by Air Algrie vanished from radar screens around 50 minutes after taking off from Burkina Faso en route to Algiers. It had reportedly asked to divert from its planned course because of heavy rain and poor visibility over northern Mali. Early on Friday authorities in Mali and Burkina Faso said wreckage had been found on Malian territory scattered and burned, with no survivors. The office of the French president, Franois Hollande, later made the same announcement, saying the plane lay in pieces but had been positively identified. \"A French military unit has been sent to secure the site and gather the first elements of information,\" said a statement from the lyse Palace. Malian state television said the plane crashed between the town of Gossi, about 30 miles (50km) from the Burkina Faso border. Reports of the discovery were repeated by government officials in both countries and by Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, the president of Mali. There had been reports of massive sandstorms in the region before the plane disappeared shortly after changing course. It was not thought to have transmitted any distress signal. Officials in Burkina Faso, Algeria and France said no hypotheses were being ruled out, including a terrorist bombing or hijack, but seriously doubted that the Islamist forces and militias in northern Mali possessed surface-to-air missiles powerful enough to shoot down the plane. Almost half the passengers on board, 51 people, were reported to be French. The three airliner crashes in the last week have claimed nearly 450 lives. Seven days ago Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 on board  including 193 Dutch citizens, 10 Britons, four Germans, four Belgians as well as dozens of Malaysians, Australians and Indonesians. On Wednesday a TransAsia Airways flight in Taiwan crashed in bad weather, killing 48 passengers including two French exchange students. Two French Mirage-2000 planes on Thursday searched the area where the Algeria-bound aircraft was thought to have crashed: the largely inaccessible region of Gao in northern Mali. Tension between various armed groups and militia, including Islamic extremists and Tuaregs, is high in the area. Its capital, Gao city, is on the river Niger about 190 miles south-east of Timbuktu. The French president, Franois Hollande, summoned key ministers to a crisis meeting on Thursday afternoon, postponing a planned visit to France's Indian Ocean territories. He said \"all military and civilian means\" in the region of the crash would be mobilised to establish its cause. France has 1,600 troops in Mali as part of Operation Serval, which started at the beginning of last year and is aimed at ousting Islamist militants in the north of the country. Hollande said: \"My thoughts are with the anguished families and friends waiting at airports and express our solidarity, the solidarity of the nation. It is a moment of pain for the families and friends of 116 people, 51 of whom are our compatriots. We are in a series [of crashes] but there is no series because every situation is different  we have to establish what happened.\" Laurent Fabius, the foreign minister, said the aircraft had \"probably crashed\". \"The search is concentrated on a vast part of Malian territory around Gao. Our forces in the region, including medical units, have been mobilised.\" He said that if the crash were confirmed it would be \"a major tragedy that has hit our whole nation and others\". The plane, a McDonnell Douglas 83, had taken off from the Burkina Faso capital of Ouagadougou and was supposed to take a direct route to Algiers. Air traffic controllers lost contact with the aircraft, owned by the Spanish company Swiftair, at 0117 GMT, but its disappearance was not made public until several hours after its 0410 GMT scheduled arrival time in the Algerian capital. On Thursday evening, hours after the plane's disappearance, the exact identity of the passengers was still shrouded in confusion. French media reported that Zoheir Houaoui of Air Algrie had confirmed the plane was carrying 50 French passengers, six Algerians, one Malian, one Belgian, two from Luxembourg, five Canadians, one from Cameroon, four Germans, one Nigerian, eight Lebanese, one Romanian, 24 from Burkina Faso and six so far unidentified passengers. The six crew members  two pilots and four stewards  were all Spanish. Of the French passengers 22 were said to have been due to transfer on to flights to Paris or Marseilles after landing at Algiers. France's air safety control body, the Direction Gnrale de l'Aviation Civil, said the plane that disappeared had been checked in Marseilles a few days ago and declared airworthy. According to its corporate webpage, Swiftair was founded in 1986 and provides passenger and cargo planes in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. The McDonnell Douglas MD-83 is part of the MD-80 series of aircraft, with a range of up to 4,600km. It is capable of carrying up to 167 passengers. Gerard Arnoux, an Air France pilot, said the plane was \"old\" but its age was less important than the fact it appeared to have been maintained. \"It's an old plane, made probably in the 1990s, but I don't have any problem in that.

{"text": "Aviation experts, criminal investigators and soldiers began converging Friday on an isolated patch of restive Mali to search for clues that might explain why an Air Algerie jetliner fell from the sky in a storm and apparently disintegrated on impact. French authorities said the catastrophe was probably the result of extreme bad weather, but they refused to exclude other possibilities, like terrorism, without a full investigation. All 118 people aboard the plane were killed. The loss of flight 5017 wiped out whole families. Nearly half of the dead were French. The passenger list also included other Europeans, Canadians and Africans. The six crew members were Spanish. One man pleaded with French officials not to hold back any information about the crash that killed his brother and other family members. \"Tell us. Especially give us an explanation,\" Amadou Ouedraogo asked on BFM-TV. French authorities planned to meet Saturday with victims' families. The MD-83 was flying from Ouagadougou, capital of Burkina Faso, to Algiers, Algeria, when it disappeared early Thursday just 50 minutes after takeoff  the third crash of a passenger plane in the last week. More than 200 French, Malian and Dutch troops from the United Nations force in Mali secured the site ahead of the arrival this weekend of aviation and criminal investigators. France has opened a manslaughter investigation because of the 54 French victims. One of plane's two black boxes was found Friday and sent to Gao, the northern Mali city where a contingent of French troops is based. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said victims' remains would be sent to Gao for identification before being returned home. Difficult access to the area and instability could hinder the investigation. Gao is in the heart of a still-restive desert and mountain area in northern Mali that fell under the control of Tuareg separatists, then al-Qaida linked Islamist extremists after a 2012 military coup. French forces intervened in the west African country in January 2013 to rout Islamist extremists controlling the region. A French soldier was killed earlier this month in the Gao region. The debris field to the south is in a concentrated area in the Gossi region near the border with Burkina Faso. The area is \"in a zone of savannah and sand with very difficult access, especially in this rainy season,\" Fabius said at a presentation with the defense and transport ministers. Traveling by road from the debris field to Gossi would take six hours, he said, stressing that the field investigation could take time. Col. Patrick Tourron of the French Gendarmerie's victim-identification unit told BFM-TV that fingerprints, DNA and teeth would provide the primary clues to each victim's identity. Surviving family members were to be asked for victims' toothbrushes and the names of their dentists, he said. Video of the wreckage site taken by a soldier from Burkina Faso, the nation first on the scene, showed unrecognizable debris scattered over a desolate area dotted with scrubby vegetation. There were bits of twisted metal but no identifiable parts such as the fuselage or tail, or victims' bodies. An aerial view shown later on French television revealed similar devastation. Investigators from Mali, Burkina Faso, Algeria and Spain were joining the inquiry, the French foreign minister said. It's too early to know \"with absolute certitude\" what caused the disaster, Fabius said, but he noted major storms in the region. The pilot of the jet had advised controllers in Niger that he needed to change routes because of a storm, Burkina Faso Transport Minister Jean Bertin Ouedraogo said Thursday. Contact with the plane was then lost. A French Reaper drone based in neighboring Niger spotted the wreckage after getting alerts from Burkina Faso and Malian soldiers, Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told reporters. \"There are hypotheses, notably weather-related, but we don't rule out anything because we want to know what happened,\" French President Francois Hollande said Friday after a crisis meeting. Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve reiterated the same message: \"We think the plane went down due to weather conditions.\" But, speaking on RTL radio, he added: \"Terrorist groups are in the zone. ... We know these groups are hostile to Western interests.\" The jet, owned by the Spanish airline Swiftair, had passed its annual air navigation certificate inspection in January without any problems, Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said Friday. The European Aviation Safety Agency also carried out a \"ramp inspection\"  or unannounced spot check  of the plane in June. Santamaria said another ramp inspection was done in Marseille, France, on July 22  two days before the plane went down. Ramp inspections \"are limited to on-the-spot assessments and cannot substitute for proper regulatory oversight,\" the EASA website says. \"Ramp inspections serve as pointers, but they cannot guarantee the airworthiness of a particular aircraft.\" A Malaysia Airlines flight was shot down last week over war-torn eastern Ukraine.

{"text": "French troops have located the wreckage of the Air Algrie flight that disappeared on Thursday and there were no survivors, President Franois Hollande has announced. A French military drone found the crashed plane in the Gossi area of Mali near the border with Burkina Faso, from where the flight had taken off en route for Algiers. About 100 French soldiers, based in Mali as part of Operation Serval to drive Islamic extremists from the African state, arrived at the site on Friday morning. Hollande said they had found one of the plane's flight recorders, which had been sent for examination to the town of Gao, where French troops are garrisoned. French air accident experts were flying out to the scene, he added. However, he confirmed that all 118 people on board  112 passengers (including 54 French citizens) and six Spanish crew  had perished in the accident. Earlier reports had put the number of passengers and crew at 116. \"Sadly, there are no survivors,\" Hollande told journalists after a crisis meeting of ministers at the Elyse on Friday morning. He said the foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, would meet the victims' families and they would be given \"all the information they need\". \"My thoughts are with the victims and their families. We stand at their side,\" he said. He added that atrocious weather conditions in the region were believed to have caused the accident and the wreckage was found in a concentrated area, but said: \"No hypothesis has been ruled out  it is still too soon to draw any conclusions.\" Gilbert Djendr, a presidential spokesman in Burkina Faso, said a recovery team had located the wreckage on Thursday afternoon. \"The plane completely disintegrated [on impact]\" he said. A Burkina Faso minister who spoke on condition of anonymity said: \"There are no phone lines in Gossi, which is why it was so difficult to confirm any information. It was nomads who saw the plane falling during the night, and they alerted the Burkinabe army. \"It's an unstable region, full of drugs traffickers and car hijackers,\" he said, adding that the Burkinabe soldiers had secured the site ahead of Malian troops expected to accompany the president there on Friday. Gossi is 90 miles (140km) from the strategic garrison town Gao, which has been the scene of fierce fighting, Gossi. It is sparsely populated and inhabited mostly by nomadic Tuaregs. Mali's northern region was engulfed by fighting during the 2012 conflict. In May this year 50 Malian soldiers were killed during clashes between the army and Tuareg rebels. Authorities said the plane broke on impact rather than in the sky, all but ruling out the remote possibility it was shot down.Flight AH5017 had taken off from Ougadougou, capital of Burkino Faso, in the early hours of Thursday. About 40 minutes later, shortly after the pilot asked to divert from his flight route to avoid heavy storms, the aircraft dropped off the radar. It was only after the plane failed to arrive as scheduled in Algiers that it was announced missing. The French transport minister, Frdric Cuvillier, said the accident was probably due to \"extremely bad weather conditions\". \"Was that the sole cause, or was there a technical problem, which compounded the situation? That we will have to find out,\" Cuvillier said. Relatives who have gathered in a crisis centre in Ouagadougou airport have been told there are no survivors. \"We don't understand why there is no representative of Air Algeria,\" said one man who gave his name only as Tha. \"We need to know what happened. Some people are wailing but we are mostly just shocked.

{"text": "The wreckage of a plane that disappeared with 116 people on board on a flight from Burkina Faso to Algiers has been found in Mali, officials say. French troops based in the region are on their way to secure the site, about 50km (30 miles) from the border with Burkina Faso, French officials said. Air traffic controllers lost contact with the plane early on Thursday after pilots reported severe storms. The passengers on the Air Algerie flight included 51 French citizens. The McDonnell Douglas MD-83 - Flight AH 5017 - had been chartered from Spanish airline Swiftair. French President Francois Hollande expressed solidarity with the friends and families of those on board. \"A French military unit has been sent to (the area) to secure the site and gather evidence,\" his office said in a statement (in French). The statement went on to say that the plane had \"disintegrated\", without giving further details. France's Interior Minister said it appeared likely the plane had crashed due to bad weather. 'Burnt and scattered' The crash site was identified on Thursday by the Burkina Faso army near the village of Boulikessi, officials said. Gilbert Diendere, a Burkina Faso army general, said Mali had agreed to their cross-border search which was launched after a resident in Gossi described seeing a plane go down to the south-west of the town. \"Sadly, the team saw no-one on site. It saw no survivors,\" he told reporters. \"They found human remains and the wreckage of the plane totally burnt and scattered,\" he added. Malian state radio said shepherds had been the first to spot the wreckage and had informed the authorities, the BBC's Alex Duval Smith reports from the Malian capital, Bamako. 'Sandstorm' French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve told French radio network RTL that \"the aircraft was destroyed at the moment it crashed\", meaning that it did not appear likely that the plane was attacked mid-flight. \"We think the aircraft crashed for reasons linked to the weather conditions, although no theory can be excluded at this point,\" he said. Earlier, French fighter jets and UN helicopters had been hunting for the wreck in the more remote desert region of northern Mali between Gao and Tessalit. Contact with Flight AH 5017 was lost about 50 minutes after take-off from Ouagadougou early on Thursday morning, Air Algerie said. The pilot had contacted Niger's control tower in Niamey at around 01:30 GMT to change course because of a sandstorm, officials say. Burkina Faso authorities said the passenger list comprised 27 people from Burkina Faso, 51 French, eight Lebanese, six Algerians, two from Luxembourg, five Canadians, four Germans, one Cameroonian, one Belgian, one Egyptian, one Ukrainian, one Swiss, one Nigerian and one Malian. The six crew members are Spanish, according to the Spanish pilots' union. French ties Flight AH 5017 flies the Ouagadougou-Algiers route four times a week, AFP reported. BBC West Africa correspondent Thomas Fessy says it a route often used by French travellers. France sent troops to Mali in January 2013 after al-Qaeda-linked militants threatened to overrun the capital, Bamako. It ended its military deployment in Mali in July, but agreed to keep troops in the region as part of a new military operation based in Chad, focused on targeting Islamist extremists in the Sahel region.

{"text": "French forces who secured the site of a crashed Air Algerie flight in Mali found one flight recorder but no survivors, French President Francoise Hollande said Friday. Wreckage of the jet was found in a \"disintegrated state\" in Mali, he said, making it the third major international aviation disaster in recent days. \"Regrettably, there were no survivors. I share the pain of the families, who are going through terrible hardship,\" he said. Hollande said the families of the French nationals aboard the plane -- the largest group from any one nation -- would be welcomed to the Foreign Ministry on Saturday to be given all the latest information. Airline authorities said Flight 5017 was carrying 116 people when it took off early Thursday from Burkina Faso to Algeria. Less than an hour into the flight, the aircraft, an MD-83, disappeared from radar after changing its flight path because of bad weather, officials said. The one \"black box\" recorder found so far is being taken to Gao, Mali, and will be examined as soon as possible, Hollande said. \"What we already know is that the plane's debris is concentrated in a limited area,\" he said. \"But it is still too early to draw any conclusions, they will come in time. There are hypotheses, including weather conditions, but we are not putting any of them aside because we want to find out everything that happened.\" The plane's wreckage was found in Mali's Gossi region, not very far from the border with Burkina Faso, according to the French President. Turbulent area Radar contact with the plane was lost 50 minutes after takeoff from the Burkina Faso capital of Ouagadougou, authorities said. The jet was supposed to arrive later that day at Houari Boumediene Airport in Algiers. Mali is between the two nations. Though the cause of the crash is unknown, the flight path took the aircraft through a turbulent area hit by regular thunderstorms at this time of year, according to CNN meteorologist Mari Ramos. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said the cause of the accident was still unknown but that \"significant storms were active in the area and the crew explicitly had the attention to reroute due to weather before losing contact with aircraft,\" according to CNN's French affiliate BFMTV. Differing accounts continue to emerge of the number and nationalities of people on the plane. Air Algerie said the plane was carrying 110 passengers and six crew members, but Hollande gave a different number. \"My thoughts go to the 118 victims, those close to them and their families,\" he said. Hollande said 51 French nations were on board but at a news conference later Friday, broadcast by BFMTV. Fabius put the number at 54. Fabius said the aim was to bring the victims' remains as quickly as possible to Gao, so that they can be identified and returned to their home countries. Mamadou Zoungrana told CNN Canadian affiliate CBC that his wife and two sons were on the flight. She had wanted to leave on an earlier flight. \"I didn't want to change the flight,\" he said. \"I said it will be OK. Maybe if I canceled.\" The plane's departure country of Burkina Faso had 24 people aboard, the airline said, while Lebanon had eight. The passengers also included six Algerians; five Canadians; four Germans; two from Luxembourg; and one each from Mali, Cameroon, Belgium, Ukraine, Romania, Nigeria and Egypt, Air Algerie said. Air Algerie said all six crew members were Spanish. The plane belongs to a private Spanish company, Swiftair, but was operated by Air Algerie. Burkina Faso's Prime Minister Luc Adolphe Tiao said 28 of those aboard were from Burkina Faso, four more than the number stated by the airline. The presidents of the European Commission and European Parliament, Jose Manuel Barroso and Herman Van Rompuy, expressed their \"deepest condolences\" to the families of the victims in a joint statement Friday. \"We also wish to express our sympathy and solidarity to the governments of all affected nations, including to the French and Algerian Presidents,\" they said. Burkina Faso: No link to our role in Mali The wreckage was located by a helicopter sent by Burkina Faso, Tiao said, according to his government's website. He also said there was \"no link\" between the crash and the mediating role played by Algeria and his own country in the ongoing conflict in northern Mali between government forces, backed up by French troops, and Islamist militants. He said the three countries must work hand in hand to clarify the situation and support the families of the victims. Air Algerie's crash came less than 24 hours after a twin-engine plane crashed while attempting to land Wednesday in Taiwan's Penghu Islands, killing 48 of the 58 people on board, and a week after Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was downed in Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board. Air Algerie, Algeria's national airline, flies to 28 countries. Until this week, the deadliest incident in the airline's history occurred in March 2003 when a domestic flight crashed after takeoff, killing 102 people on board. One person survived.

The social network said Thursday it had launched an Internet.org app in Zambia to provide free access to Facebook and other online services to people who might otherwise have no Internet access. The app is a partnership with Indias Bharti Airtel, and available only to Bharti subscribers in Zambia. Internet.org is a Facebook-led initiative aimed at getting more people online. Facebook says only 30% of the world uses the Internet, though 85% of the population lives within range of cellular data connections. Cost is a barrier. To reduce concerns, Facebook has been urging mobile carriers in developing nations to let customers try Facebook for free, arguing that some users would later buy a data connection. The Internet.org app, which is designed to work on low-end Android phones and feature phones, expands Facebooks efforts to get people online. Facebook says its talking with mobile carriers in other countries about offering the app, and not charging for data to use it. Affordability and awareness are significant barriers to Internet adoption for many, said Guy Rosen, a product management director for Internet.org, in a statement. With the Internet.org app, users can also get access to services like AccuWeather,Google Search and Wikipedia without paying for a data connection.

{"text": "FACEBOOK Inc is launching a mobile app that gives users in Zambia free access to a handful of online services on mobile phones, broadening an effort to boost Internet usage in underdeveloped countries. The Internet.org app will offer, in partnership with wireless operator Airtel , more than a dozen services including online encyclopedia Wikipedia, websites devoted to weather, job listings and health information, as well as Facebook's own social network and messaging service. The app will be available in additional countries over the coming months and years, Guy Rosen, product management director for Facebook's Internet.org effort said on Wednesday. FACEBOOK will not pay Airtel for the bandwidth, Rosen said, but Airtel will benefit as users who are exposed to Internet services eventually decide to pay for broader, unrestricted access. Access to the information on the app's included services is free, but links that lead to information on other websites will require that users pay wireless data charges. The free version of Facebook in the app does not allow for the video playback. Facebook has partnered with more than 150 wireless providers over the past four years to offer free or discounted access to its social network, but the new app in Zambia marks the first time the company has added Web services beyond its own social network to the menu of free services. The move comes as Facebook steps up investments in its Internet.org project, which seeks to connect the next 5 billion users to the Internet, many of whom lives in places like Africa and INDIA.

{"text": "Facebooks latest mobile application is only available in one country to customers of one mobile operator, but its part of the social networks much bigger plans for the developing world. The company has launched its Internet.org app in Zambia, as an Android app for people using the Airtel mobile network. The app provides access to Facebook and its Messenger instant-messaging service, as well as Wikipedia, Google search and AccuWeather, as well as local health and jobs services including Go Zambia Jobs, Mobile Alliance for Maternal Action and Womens Rights App. Facebooks deal with Airtel means people using the app will not have to pay data charges for using any of these services. By providing free basic services via the app, we hope to bring more people online and help them discover valuable services they might not have otherwise, wrote Facebooks product management director Guy Rosen in a blog post. Rosen added that the company plans to continue to improve the experience and roll it out to other parts of the world as it strikes more agreements with mobile operators. Facebook originally launched its Internet.org initiative in August 2013, with fellow technology companies Samsung, Qualcomm, Ericsson, Nokia, Opera and MediaTek joining the social network as founder members. Its stated goal is removing barriers in developing countries to connecting and joining the knowledge economy by reducing the costs of getting online through mobile devices. Obviously, spreading Facebooks services in these countries is part of that too. The inclusion of Google search in the new Internet.org app is an interesting development, since Google was not one of its founder members, and has run its own zero-data initiative called Free Zone  including a partnership with Airtel in India. Googles own services:  Gmail and Google Plus as well as search  are its focus. Google and Facebook are also competing to find new ways of delivering internet access to remote parts of the world that arent well served by existing mobile networks. Googles Project Loon is a network of high-altitude balloons. We believe that it might actually be possible to build a ring of balloons, flying around the globe on the stratospheric winds, that provides internet access to the earth below, explained its project head Mike Cassidy in June 2013. And Facebook? In our effort to connect the whole world with Internet.org, weve been working on ways to beam internet to people from the sky, wrote Zuckerberg in a status update in March 2014, citing drones, satellites and lasers to deliver the internet to everyone. Facebook isnt flying laser-toting drones over Zambia just yet, but with the Internet.org apps launch through a traditional mobile operator, the country is at the forefront of the social networks global growth ambitions. Zambia will now be the first country where weve been able to provide a whole set of free basic services, wrote Zuckerberg in a new status update as the Internet.org app was announced.

{"text": "It's the new frontier for the internet - connecting billions of people in Africa and Asia who have yet to sample the delights of the digital world. Through an organisation called Internet.org, Facebook has put itself at the forefront of this mission. Today it unveils a clever plan to get millions of people in Zambia online. It is without doubt a laudable philanthropic mission - but in the long run it could also be hugely important to Facebook's growth. As Guy Rosen of Internet.org explained to me over a video link from Facebook's Menlo Park headquarters, 85% of those people who aren't connected to the internet are in places with mobile phone coverage. There are two reasons why, despite the widespread use of mobile phones, they have not tried the internet - affordability and awareness. In other words, data use on a mobile phone is far too expensive for most people and they have no idea of what advantages it might offer them. The plan in Zambia is to address both those issues. The mobile operator Airtel - like a number in Africa - has been offering a simple Facebook experience for free on mobile phones. Now in Zambia it will offer an Internet.org app which will supply Facebook but also a number of other web services. Users will get access to Wikipedia, job sites, weather forecasts, and information about health, all without paying any data charges. Users will be able to access these web services from simple feature phones by visiting the internet.org website, and they will get a warning if they stray onto sites where data charges apply. Only 15% of the 15 million people in Zambia have used the internet so far - now it is hoped that many more will try it. If the pilot is successful, the same method will be used with other mobile operators in other parts of Africa. Now Airtel is obviously forgoing some revenue from data to get this scheme off the ground, in the hope that some of those who try out the internet on a mobile will pay for the service in the future. But I was somewhat surprised to learn that Facebook is making no contribution to the cost of the data. Mobile phones will provide the first experience of the internet for the vast majority of those now trying it for the first time. The words \"internet\" and \"Facebook\" are already said to be interchangeable in some places in Africa. Now this initiative is bound to make millions more see Facebook as the gateway to the online world. Mark Zuckerberg's passionate interest in internet.org's mission certainly seems genuine. But a business with 1.3 billion users that needs to to show investors that those numbers are continuing to rise will now be looking to Africa and Asia to increase its audience. So the philanthropic mission of internet.org and Facebook's long-term business strategy are in perfect alignment.", "label": {"what": ["offering a simple Facebook experience for free on mobile phones", "If the pilot is successful, the same method will be used with other mobile operators in other parts of Africa"], "when": ["Today"], "where": ["in Africa and Asia", "in Zambia"], "why": ["affordability and awareness", "data use on a mobile phone is far too expensive for most people and they have no idea of what advantages it might offer them", "Mobile phones will provide the first experience of the internet for the vast majority of those now trying it for the first time", "the philanthropic mission of internet.org and Facebook's long-term business strategy are in perfect alignment"], "who": ["an organisation called Internet.org", "Guy Rosen of Internet.org", "Facebook", "Airtel ", "Mark Zuckerberg"], "product_name": ["Internet.org"], "countermeasures": ["Airtel is obviously forgoing some revenue from data to get this scheme off the ground"], "new_features": ["Users will get access to Wikipedia, job sites, weather forecasts, and information about health, all without paying any data charges", "Users will be able to access these web services from simple feature phones", "get a warning if they stray onto sites where data charges apply"], "effects": ["this initiative is bound to make millions more see Facebook as the gateway to the online world"]}}

{"text": "Apple and IBM have announced a business partnership that will see the two firms co-develop business-centric apps for iPhones and iPads. In addition, IBM will start selling business clients Apple's mobile devices pre-installed with the new software. The two firms were one-time rivals, with Apple's 1984 advert depicting itself as an upstart challenging what was a dominant IBM. One expert said it was too soon to know how significant the deal would be. \"It's hard to be sure without more details,\" said Ken Dulaney, an analyst at the tech consultancy Gartner. \"Enterprises need special features to protect their applications and the associated data. Our understanding is that IBM now has special access rights to certain security features on the devices that others will not have access to. \"This permits IBM to offer applications and services through Apple devices that behave more like the software businesses have long built on Windows platforms. \"But unknown things include what apps will be produced and what is the financial arrangement between the firms.\" Co-developed apps The firms' press release provides limited detail about what the first \"IBM MobileFirst Platform for iOS\" apps will do, beyond saying they would draw on IBM's expertise at analysing large amounts of information to help \"retail, healthcare, banking, travel and transportation, telecommunications and insurance\" among other industries make efficiency gains and take advantage of the cloud. It does, however, mark a fresh attempt by Apple to take advantage of Blackberry's decline and an appetite from the business world for an alternative to Microsoft's products. Analysis:  Kamal Ahmed, BBC Business Editor The partnership between two of the world's global technology giants sees Apple stepping up its efforts to transfer its dominance in the consumer market to the highly lucrative market servicing business users. Who should be worried? Well, Microsoft (already huge in this market) and Google (growing rapidly) will take a close look at what the joint venture means. But it's Blackberry that will be feeling the most sweaty this morning. Business users - managers still wedded to their \"Crackberries\" despite all the problems the Canadian company has faced - and security obsessed governments could have their heads turned by bespoke aps and business services on iPads and iPhones backed by IBM's famed big data and analytics expertise. However, last week Microsoft's chief executive, Satya Nadella released a memo in which he also promised to \"reinvent productivity to empower every person and every organisation on the planet to do more and achieve more\" with his firm's own set of cloud-based products. Although the Apple-IBM announcement promises more than 100 new \"solutions\" as a result of the deal, it will not be the first time IBM has released products for iOS. The company already offers social network, email, and chat software for the platform among other programs. It has also released apps for devices running Google's rival Android operating system.

{"text": "Tim Cook has steered Apple through three years of increased competition from rivals since he took the helm as the tech giant's CEO. When visionary founder Steve Jobs chose Cook as his successor, he offered two pieces of advice:  Not to think of what he (Jobs) would do and to do whats right. In the past few months, Cook has shown the breadth of his vision for Apple by taking charge on two vastly different deals. He helped make Dr. Dre the self-proclaimed first billionaire in hip hop with the $3 billion acquisition of Beats -- a company known best for their premium line of headphones. Cook unveiled another deal Tuesday when he announced Apple would team up with IBM, a former rival, to sell more iPads and iPhones to corporate customers. \"I think that from a high level Cook is willing to work with people where Steve Jobs was not willing to work with people,\" Gene Munster, senior research analyst at Piper Jaffray, told ABC News. \"He clearly believes more in cooperation versus competition.\" Patrick Moorhead, principal technology analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy, told ABC News that the diversity of the deals show Cook is \"positioning himself as a unique leader.\" \"He seems to embrace things that a previous Apple wouldnt do before,\" Moorhead said. That means working with IBM -- the original Big Brother company that Apple poked fun at in the groundbreaking \"1984\" TV commercial. While 98 percent of Fortune 500 companies use iOS devices, according to Cook, the IBM partnership will allow Apple a way of bringing its products to corporate customers who may be using other devices, while integrating IBM's data and analytics. The companies will also collaborate on a \"MobileFirst\" platform of industry-specific business apps, including retail, healthcare, banking, travel, transportation, telecommunications and insurance, among others. According to Apple, enterprise solutions will begin rolling out this fall and into 2015. \"It is big in that Apple has historically put no effort into enterprise,\" Munster said of the partnership. But \"if you look at the impact of the numbers, it's a little bit more of a gray area.\" Under Cooks stewardship, Moorhead said he expects to see even more partnerships and acquisitions in the future, cementing not just a new era at Apple, but Cooks legacy as a leader who can \"think different.\" \"I would expect more partnerships, more acquisitions, more collaboration,\" Moorhead said.", "label": {"what": ["announced Apple would team up with IBM, a former rival, to sell more iPads and iPhones to corporate customers", "The companies will also collaborate on a MobileFirst platform of industry-specific business apps, including retail, healthcare, banking, travel, transportation, telecommunications and insurance, among others"], "when": ["Tuesday", "this fall and into 2015"], "why": ["two pieces of advice:  Not to think of what he (Jobs) would do and to do what's right", "Cook is willing to work with people where Steve Jobs was not willing to work with people", "believes more in cooperation versus competition", "the IBM partnership will allow Apple a way of bringing its products to corporate customers who may be using other devices, while integrating IBM's data and analytics"], "who": ["Tim Cook", "Apple", "founder Steve Jobs", "Dr. Dre", "Gene Munster, senior research analyst at Piper Jaffray", "Patrick Moorhead, principal technology analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy"], "how": ["expects to see even more partnerships and acquisitions in the future", "expect more partnerships, more acquisitions, more collaboration"]}}

{"text": "BlackBerry has had a heck of a year. The stock is up nearly 35% in 2014 as investors embrace the turnaround strategy from new CEO John Chen. Now Chen may face his biggest challenge yet:  A direct assault from two tech titans. Apple (AAPL, Tech30) and IBM (IBM, Tech30) announced a partnership that will let Big Blue offer souped-up iPhones and IPads to corporate customers. Shares of BlackBerry (BBRY, Tech30) plunged nearly 12% Wednesday on the news. Although BlackBerry is losing the consumer smartphone battle to Apple, companies like Samsung that sell phones running on Google's (GOOG) Android and even Microsoft, it has remained popular in the IT departments of many corporations and government agencies. The BlackBerry is still the mobile device of choice for many big businesses, partly due to security reasons. But that too is changing as more companies allow their workers to connect personal devices to corporate networks. If BlackBerry loses even more share of the small device business, then the company's turnaround may come to a screeching halt. To Chen's credit, he still has time to get BlackBerry back on track. The company reported an increase in its cash position in its most recent quarter. Chen is also steering BlackBerry into the connected home and auto markets with its QNX software. And then there's the recent deal that will let BlackBerry 10.3 customers access Android apps on Amazon's (AMZN, Tech30) app store later this fall.

{"text": "BlackBerry shares dropped Wednesday after details emerged of a partnership between two of the world's biggest technology companies - Apple and IBM - aimed at business customers. IBM Corp. will be creating more business-themed applications for iPhones and iPads. IBM and Apple Inc. said late Tuesday that the apps are expected to be released this fall. The more than 100 IBM apps will cater to specific industries, like retail and health care. The partnership comes as BlackBerry is trying to reaffirm its position catering to businesses and government agencies that require secure mobile communications. As more of BlackBerry's competitors turn their attention to the highly lucrative, and generally loyal, enterprise market, the Canadian company could begin to feel extra pressure. William Blair analyst Anil Doradla said he believes the Apple and IBM partnership will be a \"long-term negative\" for BlackBerry. \"In the likely scenario of Apple/IBM doing well in servicing the needs of enterprise customers, we see little reason for enterprises to choose BlackBerry's platform over Apple's,\" he wrote in a note. Blackberry took an optimistic tone, however, saying in an email that it \"only underscores the ongoing need for secure end-to-end enterprise mobility solutions like those BlackBerry has delivered for years.\" BlackBerry Ltd., formerly known as Research In Motion, was once Canada's most valuable company, with a market value of $83 billion in June 2008. But the stock plummeted as BlackBerry was hammered by competition from the iPhone and Android-based phones. BlackBerry has dedicated more resources to building its relationship with business customers under the leadership of chief executive John Chen, who joined the company last November. He was hired to reshape BlackBerry, cut costs and find a better footing in the competitive tech sector. Before he took the job, he helped turn software company Sybase into a profitable operation focused on mobile business technology. His strategy has set aside the consumer market as a priority, after the BlackBerry 10 line of phones failed to become a sales hit.

{"text": "What was once the world's largest trading platform for bitcoins is now a blank page. The Bitcoin-trading website Mt.Gox was taken offline late Monday, putting at risk millions of dollars put there by investors who gambled on the digital currency. The exchange also deleted all of its tweets, and Mt.Gox CEO Mark Karpeles resigned from the Bitcoin Foundation's board of directors on Sunday. The news frightened Bitcoin investors elsewhere, knocking the price down about 3% to $490 -- its lowest level since November. For now, there's no telling what's behind the shutdown. Mt.Gox did not respond to requests for comment. However, an unverified document called \"Crisis Strategy Draft\" that is being circulated online claims Mt.Gox has lost 744,408 of its users' bitcoins, worth nearly $367 million. It also claims Mt.Gox is planning to rebrand itself as Gox. Share your story:  Do you have bitcoins? Mt.Gox has been mired in problems ever since Feb. 7, when it halted withdrawals from its trading accounts. The company's computer programmers hadn't accounted for a quirk in the way Bitcoin works, allowing cyber attackers to dupe Mt.Gox with a scheme resembling receipt fraud. When Mt.Gox discovered it was under attack, it stopped any investors from pulling their money out of their trading platform -- but it has yet to allow them access to their money. By the time trading at Mt.Gox was halted entirely late Monday, the price of a Bitcoin there had dropped significantly, to $130. Meanwhile it was trading for more than four times that on other exchanges. Late on Monday, several other Bitcoin exchanges sought to reassure investors and took a harder line with Mt. Gox. \"This tragic violation of the trust of users of Mt.Gox was the result of one company's abhorrent actions and does not reflect the resilience or value of Bitcoin and the digital currency industry,\" the groups said in a statement. The executives who signed the joint statement cast Mt.Gox's downfall as the typical industry evolution that weeds out bad actors. Although Mt.Gox's shutdown was unexpected, its piling troubles were no surprise. Evan Rose, president of Bitcoin ATM company Genesis, said that the kinds of problems seen at Mt.Gox and other exchanges show that Bitcoin is in flux. \"The people running the systems right now are not necessarily business men,\" Rose said. \"For the most part, they're people who came into this digital project without grasping the value or risk of it. The ecosystem is maturing, but it's a little scary for everyone involved.\"\n-- Charles Riley contributed reporting from Hong Kong. Did you have money on Mt.Gox? What about on other exchanges?

{"text": "TOKYO V  A major bitcoin exchange has gone bust after secretly racking up catastrophic losses, other virtual currency companies said Tuesday X a potentially fatal blow for the exotic new form of money. The website of Tokyo-based Mt. Gox was returning a blank page Tuesday. The disappearance of the site follows the resignation Sunday of Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles from the board of the Bitcoin Foundation, a group seeking legitimacy for the currency, and a withdrawal ban imposed at the exchange earlier this month. Prominent members of the Bitcoin community X including San Francisco-based wallet service Coinbase and Chinese exchange BTC China X sought to shore up confidence in the currency by saying Mt. Gox's collapse was an isolated case of mismanagement. They said it had abused users' trust, but did not offer details on how. \"As with any new industry, there are certain bad actors that need to be weeded out, and that is what we are seeing today,\" the statement said. Documents purportedly leaked from the company lay out the scale of the problem. An 11-page \"Crisis Strategy Draft\" published on the blog of entrepreneur and Bitcoin enthusiast Ryan Selkis says that 740,000 bitcoins are missing from Mt. Gox, which roughly translates to hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of losses, although figures are fuzzy given Bitcoin's extreme volatility. \"At the risk of appearing hyperbolic, this could be the end of Bitcoin, at least for most of the public,\" the draft said. In a post to his blog, Selkis said that the document was handed to him by a \"reliable source\" and that several people close to the company had confirmed the figures. Reached by phone, he declined further comment. The Japanese government, meanwhile, has not announced any formal investigation. The scandal may cost customers dear. At the Tokyo office tower housing Mt. Gox, bitcoin trader Kolin Burges said he had picketed the building since Feb. 14 after flying in from London, hoping to get back $320,000 he has tied up in bitcoins with Mt. Gox. \"I may have lost all of my money,\" said Burgess, next to placards asking if Mt. Gox is bankrupt. \"It hasn't shaken my trust in Bitcoin, but it has shaken my trust in bitcoin exchanges.\" Mt. Gox CEO Karpeles did not immediately return several messages seeking comment. A security officer at the office tower said no one from Mt. Gox was in the building. Tibbane, an Internet company that Karpeles is CEO of, still has its name listed on the building's directory. \"I have no idea\" where they are, said Burges, the trader. \"I'm both annoyed and worried.\" On bitcoin exchanges, the currency's value has fallen to about $470 from $550 in the past few hours, a figure already down more than 50 percent on the price of $1,200 per bitcoin reached on Mt. Gox three months ago. The disappearance of Mt. Gox could be fatal for Bitcoin, which was started in 2009 as a currency free from government controls. Bitcoin's boosters say the currency's design make it impossible to counterfeit and difficult to manipulate, and the virtual money has won an eclectic mix of die-hard fans, including libertarians, tech enthusiasts and adventurous investors. But the currency has struggled to shake off its associations with criminality, particularly its role in powering the now-defunct online drug marketplace Silk Road. Only last month another member of the Bitcoin Foundation, Vice Chairman Charlie Shrem, was arrested at New York's Kennedy Airport on charges of money laundering. Authorities have been taking an increasingly hard look at Bitcoin and related virtual currencies including Litecoin, Namecoin, Ripple, and countless others. Some countries, including Russia, have effectively banned the currency. In other jurisdictions, authorities are weighing whether to try to tame the marketplace through licenses or other mechanisms. Even if Mt. Gox doesn't drag Bitcoin down with it, there's fear that the exchange's demise will push officials to take an even more skeptical stance. \"I think this is disastrous from a (regulatory) standpoint,\" Selkis, the enthusiast, said in a message posted to Twitter. \"The hammer will now come down hard.\"", "label": {"what": ["the resignation Sunday of Mt.

{"text": "Tokyo:   The website of Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange MtGox went down on Tuesday after the value of the virtual unit sank to about a quarter of that on other platforms and Japanese regulators said they were unable to step in. Visitors to the www.mtgox.com domain got a blank page when they tried to log on, more than two weeks after the firm suspended cash withdrawals as claims swirled of a bug in the software underpinning bitcoin. The website failure came after Japanese regulators said they were powerless to intervene in an episode that has cast doubt on the viability of the crypto-unit. \"We are not in position to take action\" over the problem, said a spokesman for the Financial Services Agency of Japan, which regulates financial institutions such as banks, insurers and brokerage houses. Consternation has grown since MtGox stopped processing external transactions on February 7, claiming there was a problem with the programme that powers the currency, and allows it to be transferred between users or swapped for goods and services. The value of the unit on the exchange has gone into freefall since then. Around midday on Tuesday, a bitcoin was worth $135, compared with the $522 quoted by the CoinDesk bitcoin price index, which tracks the price of the currency on major exchanges. In January a bitcoin was worth more than $900 at MtGox, one of the world's oldest exchanges for the unit. Wild volatility has long been a part of the experimental digital currency, which does not have backing of a central bank or government and falls outside of traditional financial regulatory frameworks. Units are generated by a complex computer algorithm designed by one or more anonymous people in 2009, with a global cap on the eventual number of bitcoins set at 21 million units. Proponents say the currency is an efficient and anonymous way to store and transfer monetary value, and to avoid the risks inherent in any currency dependent on the viability of a government for its value. But some economists say the project is mired in difficulties, including large fluctuations in value caused by speculators and a supposed vulnerability to online thieves. Others note that the anonymity it offers is attractive to underworld figures and cite the unit's use on the underground Silk Road website, where it was used to buy drugs and guns. MtGox, which has not responded to repeated AFP requests for comment, issued a statement last week saying it had moved its headquarters within Tokyo due to \"security problems\" and was still working on \"re-initiating bitcoin withdrawals\". It did not give details of the security problems. \"The move, combined with some other security and technical challenges, pushed back our progress,\" the firm said Thursday in their most recent public statement. Earlier this month, the company brought down its system and stopped processing client requests to withdraw money held at its \"wallet\", citing a problem with the technology. Since then, MtGox said it had \"implemented a solution\" to the problems and insisted customers' assets were safe, but has not been able to announce the completion of its repair work. However, the apparent failure of the website on Tuesday will bring little comfort to investors, some of whom have tens of thousands of dollars' worth of the crypto-currency tied up in Tokyo. Bitcoin supporters say the digital currency itself is safe and the problems lie with MtGox, which they claim cannot process a high volume of transactions. This week, MtGox CEO Mark Karpeles resigned from the board of the Bitcoin Foundation, which advocates for the virtual currency, as he faces severe criticism from his industry colleagues and investors.

{"text": "The Bitcoin exchange industry has moved to reassure holders of the virtual currency amid reports 6% of Bitcoins in circulation, worth roughly $375m (225m), have been stolen. The once-mighty Mt Gox exchange reportedly lost them in a cyber attack, with an apparent internal document suggesting more than 740,000 Bitcoins are missing. The Mt Gox website is currently offline with trading suspended and withdrawals have been frozen. The Tokyo-based exchange has not commented on the claims but its chief, Mark Karpeles, quit the board of the Bitcoin Foundation - an advocate for the virtual currency - on the eve of the shutdown. He has not been seen in public since and his whereabouts remain unknown but in an email to the news agency Reuters he purportedly said:  \"We should have an official announcement ready soon-ish. \"We are currently at a turning point for the business. I can't tell much more for now as this also involves other parties.\" The firm's Tokyo office is said by witnesses to be largely bare while a handful of angry investors are camped outside demanding news of their money and questioning whether the business remains solvent. One of them, Bitcoin trader Kolin Burgess, said he had picketed the building since February 14 after flying in from London, hoping to get back $320,000 he had tied up in Bitcoins with Mt Gox. \"I may have lost all of my money. It hasn't shaken my trust in Bitcoin, but it has shaken my trust in Bitcoin exchanges.\" The fate of his holding is unclear as Bitcoins are traded in an unregulated, decentralised marketplace. But news of Mt Gox's apparent collapse prompted six other Bitcoin exchanges to release a joint statement distancing themselves from Mt Gox - insisting it should not be considered a reflection of the value of Bitcoin or the digital currency industry. It said:  \"This tragic violation of the trust of users of Mt Gox was the result of one company's actions. \"As with any new industry, there are certain bad actors that need to be weeded out, and that is what we are seeing today. \"Mt Gox has confirmed its issues in private discussions with other members of the Bitcoin community. \"There are hundreds of trustworthy and responsible companies involved in Bitcoin. \"These companies will continue to build the future of money by making Bitcoin more secure and easy to use for consumers and merchants.\" The signatories - Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp, BTC China, Blockchain and Circle - released their statement two days after the reported cyber attack on Mt Gox.

{"text": "The collapse of Mt Gox will be hard for bitcoin to recover from. If a leaked crisis strategy document is accurate, by the end of the sites life, its total bitcoin holdings were just 2,000btc, while customer deposits totalled 624,408btc. The reason for the discrepancy, according to the document, is a vulnerability in the bitcoin protocol, which allowed 744,408btc - about 6% of all the bitcoins presently in circulation - to be stolen from the sites cold storage, a bitcoin wallet unconnected to the main network where coins are (theoretically) safe from hacking attacks. The issue, known as transaction malleability, has been known about since 2011, and most bitcoin software is already protected from it. The Bitcoin Foundation, the non-profit devoted to development and promotion of the currency, says that any company dealing with Bitcoin transactions [which has] coded their own wallet software should responsibly prepare for this possibility. In early 2013, Mt Gox was the largest bitcoin exchange in the world, with an estimated 70% of all transactions going through the site. But the site always had problems, particularly with withdrawals. Stringent adherence to US money-laundering regulations (though based in Tokyo, it belonged to a US company, Mutum Sigillum LLC) meant it was significantly harder to sell bitcoins on the site (that is, converting them into a fiatcurrency such as dollars) than to buy them (swapping dollars for bitcoins). This caused the price to veer away from that on other exchanges. In June 2013, the site even implemented a temporary hiatus on dollar withdrawals, preventing every user from accessing their money. That hiatus officially ended after two weeks, but withdrawing dollars remained slow. Cold storage:  something went bad Then, in early February, MtGox also limited bitcoin withdrawals. Users could still use the site to trade bitcoins to other currencies within their own accounts (so if you owned 2btc you could credit your dollar account on the site with its equivalent), but couldnt withdraw their purchases to spend outside the site. The price of bitcoin on MtGox became completely disengaged from the wider bitcoin market, and plummeted below $100 last Friday; on other exchanges it was above $500. It seems likely that it was early February when the company discovered that its cold storage was gone. While the value of customer accounts was 624,408btc, the company actually only possessed the 2,000btc that were in its hot wallet V the bitcoin wallet connected directly to the exchange and used to enable trading (rather like the cash float in a cash register, as opposed to the safe in the back of the shop V which was the cold storage). Even in pure dollar-denominated debts, the crisis strategy document says the company is insolvent, with $55m of liabilities but assets of just $32m ($5m of which are held by the US Department of Homeland Security after they were seized in August 2013.) Mt Gox seems to hope this wont be the end of the road. The crisis strategy document implies a rebranding to Gox, replete with a new logo and a plea to big hitters in the bitcoin world to donate some money to ensure that depositors dont lose all their holdings. A peek at the source code of the now-blank site contains a hint of a future acquisition, with an empty space labelled put announce for mtgox acq here. But the document is also brutally honest about the likely future of MtGox V and bitcoin itself. The reality is that MtGox can go bankrupt at any moment, and certainly deserves to as a company, it reads. However, with bitcoin/crypto just recently gaining acceptance in the public eye, the likely damage in public perception to this class of technology could put it back 5~10 years, and cause governments to react swiftly and harshly. At the risk of appearing hyperbolic, this could be the end of bitcoin, at least for most of the public. Most of the bitcoin community seems prepared to try and separate perception of MtGox from that of the currency and concept itself. Marc Andreesen, whose Andreessen Horowitz venture capital firm has invested heavily in bitcoin, described the firm as obviously broken and possibly outright crooked when speaking to CNBC on Tuesday. This is like [bankrupt financial services firm] MF Global, he continued, not some huge breakdown of the underlying technology or other exchanges. Henry Blodget, formerly an equities analyst and now in charge of Business Insider, puts it like this:  Theres a chance consumer trust in bitcoin may survive. What happened to Mt Gox is essentially a bank robbery - albeit one bigger than any in recorded history (the next-biggest recorded theft is for $108m). Its actually far easier to comprehend than something like the collapse of Northern Rock or Lehman Brothers; and if those failures didnt bring down fractional reserve banking or highly leveraged derivative trading, then theres hope for bitcoin. Vanishing bitcoins, vanishing trust? But if the MtGox losses are equivalent to a bank robbery, they underscore the perception of bitcoin as a currency highly susceptible to bank robberies. Users of services including Bitcoinica, Inputs.io, and now MtGox have all seen their deposits disappear overnight. So how secure are other exchanges? Many bitcoin services were hacked together with little attention paid to long term security. For instance, MtGox incorporated encryption code which was described by its creator two years ago as quickndirty because they were too lazy to do it the proper way. In a world where a single bitcoin was worth pennies, that was acceptable, but once real money was at stake, the duct-tape approach led to problems. Bitcoin exchanges are now constantly under pressure, with a massive DDoS attack hitting some of the biggest in early February. By their nature, such exchanges are tempting targets for hackers; they are, in essence, a bitcoin wallet connected to a web interface. All too frequently, the security system in place has been easy to overwhelm. But the new generation of bitcoin companies V professional, venture-capital-backed, serious and, hopefully, secure V are fighting to change that. Their move towards reliability even extends to pushing for regulation of the currency, something which seems anathema to longer-standing users. Theres probably some minimal requirements and procedures that should be put in place if youre facilitating that kind of exchange, as Fred Ehrsam, the co-founder of bitcoin payment processor Coinbase, said to regulators in January. Others are proposing a move away from another of bitcoins guiding principles:  anonymity. Anonymity prevents reversal of transactions, but with a trend away from anonymity, transactions will be visible and thereby reversible under certain circumstances, says venture capitalist Michael Jackson of Mangrove Capital Partners. A depositor protection scheme will come. In real currencies, this protection is provided by the central banks, or currency issuers. With no central bank, the industry needs to take this role. But there isnt currently any technical basis for such a change, and its unclear if a non-anonymous bitcoin is even theoretically possible. Bitcoin still has long term issues regarding transaction speed, price volatility, and ease of use, as well as finding a killer app which isnt online drug sales. But those take a back seat to the need to credibly reassure people who own bitcoins that their cash is safe. It needs to replace Mt Gox with Fort Knox.", "label": {"what": ["In early 2013, Mt Gox was the largest bitcoin exchange in the world, with an estimated 70% of all transactions going through the site", "the price to veer away from that on other exchanges", "In June 2013, the site even implemented a temporary hiatus on dollar withdrawals, preventing every user from accessing their money", "That hiatus officially ended after two weeks, but withdrawing dollars remained slow", "in early February, MtGox also limited bitcoin withdrawals", "The price of bitcoin on MtGox became completely disengaged from the wider bitcoin market", "it was early February when the company discovered that its cold storage was gone", "A peek at the source code of the now-blank site contains a hint of a future acquisition", "The reality is that MtGox can go bankrupt at any moment", "Bitcoin exchanges are now constantly under pressure, with a massive DDoS attack hitting some of the biggest in early February", "secure V are fighting to change that.

{"text": "The most prominent Bitcoin exchange appeared to be on the verge of collapse late Monday, raising questions about the future of a volatile marketplace. On Monday night, a number of leading Bitcoin companies jointly announced that Mt. Gox, the largest exchange for most of Bitcoin s existence, was planning to file for bankruptcy after months of technological problems and what appeared to have been a major theft. A document circulating widely in the Bitcoin world said the company had lost 744,000 Bitcoins in a theft that had gone unnoticed for years. That would be about 6 percent of the 12.4 million Bitcoins in circulation. While Mt. Gox did not respond to numerous requests for comments, and the companies issuing the statement scrambled to determine the exact situation at Mt. Gox, which is based in Japan, the news helped push the price of a single Bitcoin below $500 for the first time since November, when it began a spike that took it above $1,200. But at the same time that the news about Mt. Gox was emerging, a New York firm announced plans to create an exchange that could draw the world s largest banks into the virtual currency market for the first time. The new exchange is being put together by SecondMarket, which rose to fame a few years ago after creating a platform for buying and selling shares of companies like Twitter and Facebook before they went public. Without the trouble at Mt. Gox, the SecondMarket plans would have been seen as a major boon for virtual currencies, providing a potential entry point into the Bitcoin market for large banks, which have so far avoided virtual currencies as their price has skyrocketed. Barry Silbert, SecondMarket s chief executive, said that he had already talked with several banks and financial companies about joining the new exchange, along with financial regulators, and that he hoped to have it in operation this summer. But plans for any new venture will be tested by the collapse of Mt. Gox, which could shake the faith of early Bitcoin adopters. Ryan Galt, a blogger who writes frequently about Bitcoin and was one of the first to circulate the news about Mt. Gox, wrote on Monday:   I do believe that this is one of the existential threats to Bitcoin that many have feared and have personally sold all of my Bitcoin holdings. On Monday, Mt. Gox took down all of its previous posts on Twitter, one day after its chief executive, Mark Karpeles, resigned from the board of the Bitcoin Foundation, a nonprofit that advocates for virtual currencies. A statement from the chief executives of Bitcoin companies like Coinbase, Circle, Blockchain.info and Payward, said that the  tragic violation of the trust of users of Mt. Gox was the result of one company s abhorrent actions and does not reflect the resilience or value of Bitcoin and the digital currency industry. The events are in keeping with the stark ups and downs of Bitcoin s short existence. Released in 2009 by an anonymous creator known as Satoshi Nakamoto, the Bitcoin program runs on the computers of anyone who joins in, and it is set to release only 21 million coins in regular increments. The coins can be moved between digital wallets using secret passwords. While Bitcoin fans have said the technology could provide a revolutionary new way of moving money around the world, skeptics have viewed it variously as a Ponzi scheme or an investment susceptible to fraud and theft. Many leading names in the Bitcoin community were still trying to determine the scope and potential consequences of the troubles at Mt. Gox. A document detailing the purported theft, labeled  Crisis Strategy Draft,  appeared to come from Mt. Gox. While officials at the Bitcoin Foundation could not verify the origins of the document, they were preparing for the closure of Mt. Gox. Patrick Murck, the foundation s general counsel, said that  this incident just demonstrates the need for initiatives by responsible individuals and responsible members of the Bitcoin community like what s being described  in SecondMarket s initiative. Mt. Gox s difficulties this week are only the latest in a long line of problems at the Tokyo-based exchange. Created in 2010, Mt. Gox quickly became the most popular place to buy and sell Bitcoins. But the firm has suffered several intrusions and technological mishaps, which have led to steep declines in the currency s price. A few weeks ago the company stopped allowing its customers to withdraw Bitcoins after it said it had discovered a flaw in some of the basic Bitcoin computer code. While other exchanges were briefly hit by problems, they came back online. Mt. Gox never opened up again, prompting speculation about its future. Until now, the major Bitcoin exchanges have all allowed anyone from the public to buy and sell virtual currency. SecondMarket s plan is to create a platform more like the New York Stock Exchange, where only large institutions can join and trade. Mr. Silbert says he will only open the exchange once they have several regulated financial institutions signed on as members. His hope, he says, is to give them partial ownership so that they have an incentive to trade there. For much of Bitcoin s life, banks have viewed the virtual currency with either derision or dismissiveness. Recently, though, a number of banks have released research reports that have been less negative. A December report from Bank of America said that virtual currencies could become an important new part of the payment system, allowing money to move more cheaply than it does with credit cards and money transmitters like Western Union. The statement from the Bitcoin companies on Monday night, which was not signed by Mr. Silbert, said that  in order to re-establish the trust squandered by the failings of Mt. Gox, responsible Bitcoin exchanges are working together and are committed to the future of Bitcoin and the security of all customer funds.", "label": {"what": ["The most prominent Bitcoin exchange appeared to be on the verge of collapse late Monday", "Mt.

{"text": "The virtual currency bitcoin suffered the biggest setback in its five-year history after a major exchange shut down on Tuesday, stoking concern about the future of a digital form of money traded by professional investors and ordinary people, but regulated by no one. The abrupt closure of Tokyo-based Mt. Gox underscored the risks of a virtual currency that has seen a meteoric rise in the past year. Unlike a U.S. bank failure, in which deposits are insured by the government, there may be little recourse for people whose money is locked up in the shuttered exchange. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan subpoenaed Mt. Gox this month, asking the bitcoin concern to preserve certain documents, among other things, according to a person familiar with the matter. Once the pre-eminent marketplace for buyers and sellers of bitcoin, Mt. Gox stopped all transactions on Tuesday, and its website disappeared. The site later came back, carrying only a message that said the halt was \"for the time being in order to protect the site and our users.\" The announcement came after the exchange had been experiencing technical issues for months, including a hacking attempt two weeks ago. Adding to the worries was an unconfirmed report circulating online that said Mt. Gox had lost almost 750,000 bitcoins in a long-running theft. That would represent about 6% of bitcoins in existence and be valued at about $400 million at current prices. Bitcoin prices briefly plunged more than 23% on Tuesday, based on the CoinDesk price index of two other virtual-currency exchanges. Late in the day, one bitcoin fetched about $538, down 1.2% from Monday. If Mt. Gox or its employees sent emails or financial transfers through Manhattan, federal prosecutors there could claim jurisdiction as they have in past financial cases. This month's federal subpoena was sent from the U.S. attorney's office in the Southern District of New York, said the person familiar with the matter. Attempts to reach Mt. Gox representatives in Tokyo about the subpoena were unsuccessful on Wednesday morning. Asked about the Mt. Gox development, Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said the government is collecting information through the Financial Services Agency, the Ministry of Finance and the police, with an indication of possible action in the future. Bitcoin was created in 2009 by an unknown person or group by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. It is an electronic currency that doesn't exist in a physical form and is generated, or \"mined,\" through a complicated mathematical computer process. Initially embraced by libertarians and technology buffs, bitcoin has won followers because it is anonymous, transcends national boundaries and is faster and cheaper than traditional money transfers and credit cards. But the unregulated currency isn't backed by a central bank, raising alarms about which bodies can intervene when crises arise. Bitcoin began 2013 trading at about $13 and surged to more than $1,100 by late November amid growing interest from big investors, venture-capital firms, merchants and ordinary citizens. A string of bad news out of Mt. Gox and other developments sent prices falling sharply in recent weeks. Mt. Gox began operations in 2009 as an exchange for trading cards tied to a popular online game called Magic:  The Gathering. It soon shifted its focus to bitcoin and once claimed to handle 80% of all bitcoin trading. The closing of Mt. Gox is a blow to thousands of ordinary and high-profile investors who plowed money into bitcoin in the past few years. Twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who faced off against Mark Zuckerberg over the founding of Facebook Inc., FB +0.40% are large investors in the virtual currency. They also have proposed establishing an exchange-traded mutual fund that would track the price of bitcoin. Venture capitalist and Internet pioneer Marc Andreessen is another big bitcoin investor, putting money into various startups. Messrs. Winklevoss and Andreessen couldn't be reached for comment Tuesday about the Mt. Gox situation. Erik Voorhees, another investor in bitcoin startups, said he has given up on a stash of more than 550 bitcoins that he has at Mt. Gox. At current prices, they are valued at about $300,000. \"That's gone now,\" said Mr. Voorhees, who is based in Panama City, Panama. \"There's no chance of getting that back now.\" No one knows how many investors face possible losses or how much money is at stake. Mt. Gox has been losing trading volume in recent months to rival exchanges. Efforts to reach Mt. Gox officials were unsuccessful. The trading halt underscores the risks of virtual, or computer-driven, currencies. Such instruments operate in an \"open-source\" environment, meaning anyone can participate in writing the software code that defines them. Regulators around the world have been struggling with how to categorize bitcoin and potentially set limits on the way trading exchanges such as Mt. Gox can operate. The U.S. Treasury Department, for example, has suggested that bitcoin exchanges should follow anti-money-laundering rules that apply to money-transfer companies such as Western Union Co. WU -1.82% State banking regulators in the U.S. also are scrutinizing bitcoin. The New York Department of Financial Services held two days of public hearings about virtual currencies last month as it tackles potential new rules for bitcoin companies. Executives of bitcoin businesses around the world scrambled on Tuesday to shore up confidence. \"As with any new industry, there are certain bad actors that need to be weeded out, and that is what we are seeing today,\" said three bitcoin exchanges, two payment processors and a provider of storage accounts for the currency in a joint statement. A number of mainstream merchants recently have started accepting bitcoin for payment, including online retailer Overstock.com, the Sacramento Kings professional basketball team and online dating site OKCupid. The Mt. Gox mess hasn't changed the enthusiasm of Overstock.com, which began accepting bitcoin for payment in January. \"If we didn't use greenback dollars because a bank or two failed, the greenback would never have gotten off the ground,\" said Jonathan Johnson, executive vice chairman of the discount online retailer.", "label": {"what": ["a major exchange shut down on Tuesday", "Federal prosecutors in Manhattan subpoenaed Mt.

{"text": "The end to Tokyo-based Mt. Gox raised jitters around the world, and cast doubt on the security of unregulated virtual currencies. Is it Bye Bye Bitcoins? The sudden closure of Mt. Gox - one of the world's biggest Bitcoin exchanges - could cause losses of more than 350 million U.S. dollars. Some reports say Mt. Gox suffered a hacking theft of some 750,000 Bitcoins. Angry investors gathered outside the exchange's Tokyo office to ask where their money was. Mt. Gox has been coy in its response. Its former CEO, Mark Karpeles, has already warned of the huge risks involved in trading virtual currencies. \"If you buy Bitcoins, you should buy while keeping in mind that the value could be zero the day after. For now even if it shouldn't happen, there's still a chance it could happen,\" Karpeles said. However, a London Bitcoin expert says she still feels confident about the virtual currency's future. \"There has been some panic selling over the past 12 hours or so, since the information about Mt. Gox was revealed. But actually the price dip hasn't been as severe as some people expected. It's still, at the moment, around 500 (U.S.) dollars, whereas just under 600 (U.S. dollars) at the close of play yesterday. So the decrease hasn't actually been that significant,\" said Emily Spaven, managing director at CoinDesk. Regulations are needed to avoid something like this from happening again, said Spaven. \"Governments will try and enforce some kind of regulation because, as we discovered, there's around 350 million (U.S.) dollars worth of Bitcoins that have been stolen. That's a lot of money to go missing, so I'm sure that governments will try and step in to protect their citizens from suffering something like this again,\" she said. The sudden closure of the Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange sent the virtual currency to a three-month low on Monday. However, CoinDesk says Bitcoin prices rebounded on Wednesday, rising almost four percent.

A nearby property owner discovered the vehicle at 10:  30 a.m. Tuesday, and Newberg-Dundee police detectives found Huston's body a short distance away soon after they arrived, authorities said. Police said there were no signs of foul play and no evidence to indicate that the public was in any danger. \"Because this is pending death investigation, we are not releasing the apparent cause of death,'' Chief Brian Casey of the Newberg-Dundee Police Department told a group of reporters gathered for an afternoon news conference.

Wednesday, a report from the Oregon State Medical Examiners Office said the missing Dundee womans cause of death was due to asphyxiation. However, the document did not offer details on the manner of suffocation, citing a report from KPTV. In an earlier report by The Inquisitr, the body of Jennifer Huston was found in an isolated part of Sheridan just off the rural road. Police found her remains a short distance away from her dark-colored SUV. Her body was found 12 days after she went missing (July 24). Few details are available about what led police to Jennifer Hustons body and why she committed suicide. All is known is that a number of agencies took part in a countywide search for any signs of the missing local woman. One spokesperson from the Newberg Police Department said the area where her corpse was found was in a remote area with thick brush and a large canopy of trees. Hustons body condition was not reported. Moreover, her vehicle did not show any signs of physical damage. Inside the compartment of the vehicle, Oregon investigators found a number of items the woman purchased at two local convenience stores. Grainy surveillance images and receipts confirmed she visited those locations shortly after going missing. However, the single-most important piece of evidence that assisted authorities with determining Hustons cause of death is a handwritten suicide note she allegedly left behind. At this time, the contents have not been revealed. A statement from Jennifers family was released to the public via the Newberg-Dundee Police Department after her body was found:  It reads in part:  Our hearts ache today.

Volunteer canine search teams had previously reported that their dogs had showed interest in a particular area. Wright was last seen when she went to bed on the night of Aug. 2. Her parents waited a day before calling for help because they said the girl had wandered around the Steele Creek Mobile Home Park on her own in the past.

The teenager is suspected of killing Jenise Wright, the 6-year-old girl found dead in a muddy and forested field after she went missing from her Bremerton mobile home park last weekend. Yesterday we made a promise to Jenise Paulette Wright that we would find justice for her. Today we have fulfilled that promise, said Lt. Earl Smith, a Kitsap County Sheriffs detective at a Saturday afternoon press conference. Forensic evidence analyzed by the Washington State Patrol crime lab linked the teenager to Jenise's death, Smith added. He was taken into custody on Saturday afternoon at his family's home. The suspect lived with his family at the Steele Creek Park where Jenise's also family resided, Smith said. The little girl was frequently allowed to wander and play on her own in the fenced-in community. A medical examiner deemed Jenises death a homicide on Thursday after her body was found tucked away in thick brush outside her familys mobile home park.

St. Lawrence County Sheriff Kevin Wells said at a news conference that multiple agencies were investigating leads called in by the public. He urged anyone with information to contact authorities. Pictures of the girls were not available because members of the Amish community forbid photos of themselves, which they see as a violation of their religious beliefs. I wouldnt say its hindering the investigation, its just that it would be helpful to have photos, Wells said. In the Amish world, photos arent going to be available. The girls were last seen in dark blue dresses with blue aprons and black bonnets.

{"text": "Update as of 1:  19am EDT:  Two missing Amish girls whose abduction in northern New York sparked an Amber alert have reportedly been found alive. Reuters quoted District Attorney Mary Rain as saying that the two girls, 6-year-old Delia Miller and 12-year-old Fannie Miller, were dropped by their captors in front of a stranger's home in the hamlet of Bigelow. The captors then reportedly fled. The Associated Press spoke to a neighbour who had spoken with a member of the Miller family, who said that the girls were well and being checked out. No further details about the girls' ordeal were immediately available. Original story below The hunt to find two Amish girls, who were apparently abducted from their familys roadside farm stand in New York on Wednesday, continues. Authorities were bogged down since they did not have photographs of the girls, the Associated Press reported Thursday. Since the Amish generally shun modern technology, police do not have any pictures to help identify the sisters, 7-year-old Delila Miller and 12-year-old Fannie Miller. The family agreed to release a sketch of the older child, St. Lawrence County Sheriff Kevin Wells told the AP. English is not the girls first language, he noted. The sisters were last seen wearing dark blue dresses with blue aprons and black bonnets on Wednesday evening around 7:  30 p.m. Witnesses said a white car pulled up to the stand, put something in the back seat, and then drove away. \"We will aggressively pursue this case as a worst-case scenario,\" Wells said. Authorities are pursuing \"numerous leads,\" Wells said. Divers searched St. Lawrence River to rule out the possibility the girls were in the water, investigators spoke to nearby registered sex offenders and search teams on foot tried to make sure they weren't near the familys home. The sisters neighbor Dot Simmons said it was their chore to sell fruits, vegetables and jams made from the family farm. \"The girls were always on watch if someone stopped to buy vegetables, Simmons said. When the sisters didnt come home, the family checked the cornfield, but it was unlikely the girls would have wandered off, the neighbor told the AP.

{"text": "ALBANY, N.Y. (AP)  Two missing Amish sisters turned up safe Thursday evening, about 24 hours after they were apparently abducted from their family's roadside farm stand in northern New York, authorities said. St. Lawrence County District Attorney Mary Rain said the girls were cold and wet but unharmed when they sought help at a home in Richville, about 13 miles from where they disappeared in the rural town of Oswegatchie. She said 12-year-old Fannie Miller and 7-year-old Delila Miller were dropped off and knocked on the door, asking for help getting home. A neighbor who visited the Miller family after hearing word of the girls' return said she spoke with one of their brothers, who said they were well and being checked out. There were no other details immediately available about what happened to the girls. \"We have the sheriff's department and the FBI speaking with the young ladies,\" Rain said, while noting that the Amish are a \"very private people.\" She said investigators believe more than one person was responsible for the girls' disappearance and she was confident they would be identified. Oswegatchie is a farming community of about 4,000 people on the Canadian border about 150 miles north of Albany. Word of the girls' return came shortly after about 200 people attended a candlelight prayer vigil at Cornerstone Wesleyan Church in nearby Heuvelton. They sang \"Amazing Grace\" and \"This Little Light of Mine,\" read psalms and called children to the altar for a round of prayers. Dot Simmons, a member of the congregation and neighbor of the Miller family, said despair turned to joy when she returned home from the vigil to word that the girls were safe. She and her husband got a call saying that police scanner calls were reporting the unexpected outcome and they drove next door to find an ambulance and one of the Millers' older sons sharing the good news. At the nearby police command post, authorities weren't releasing any information, but the subdued atmosphere had given way to law enforcement officers exchanging smiles and high-fives. The sisters vanished at about 7:  30 p.m. Wednesday after a white or light-colored car pulled up to the farm stand and they went down to tend to the customers while the rest of their family stayed at a barn for the evening milking. Searchers had scoured far northern New York in a hunt hampered by the lack of photos of the girls for authorities to circulate among a frightened community. There were no photos because the Amish tend to shun modern technology, but the family agreed to the release of a sketch of the older child, St. Lawrence County Sheriff Kevin Wells said. The girls are among the youngest of Mose and Barb Miller's 13 children, who range in age from 1 to 21 years, Simmons said. The girls routinely took on the chore of selling the fruits, vegetables, jams and other products of the farm, Simmons said. \"It's absolutely amazing,\" she said of their return.

Fannie Miller, 12, and Delila Miller, 6, were discovered about 36 miles from their home, cold and wet, but safe. The girls were taken from the familys roadside stand at around 7:  20 pm in Oswegatchie, New York, near the Canadian border, The Inquisitr previously reported. Witnesses say a white Sedan was at the stand just before the girls disappeared. Imagine searching for someone that youve never seen. No pictures nothing. Thats what authorities were faced with as the family, whose culture provides for no modern conveniences or technology, had no photos of the girls. Only a description of what the girls and what they were wearing, brown hair and brown eyes, dark blue dresses, blue aprons and black bonnets, and a sketch of the older sister the family agreed to work on with the authorities. ABC News reports that applause erupted at the search command center when word of their return was announced. The report also says that the entire community rallied to find the girls, despite cultural differences, and that played a key role in the girls safe return. The news came shortly after a prayer vigil attended by 200 people at Cornerstone Wesleyan Church. Fannie and Delila were dropped off in Richville, about 45 minutes away from their home, still wearing the traditional Amish attire they were last seen in. They knocked on the door of a house, and the man who answered knew them immediately because of the reports of their disappearance. The girls have been reunited with their family and seem to be healthy District Attorney Mary Rain said. Authorities havent released many details about the incident yet, but Rain indicated that more than one person may have been involved in the girls disappearance. The roadside stand was deemed a crime scene and was cordoned off. St. Lawrence County Sheriff Kevin Wells said it was a very short period of time between when the family realized the girls were missing and when authorities were notified. The family speaks mainly Pennsylvania Dutch and does not own a phone, in keeping with the Amish way of life. The phone call to authorities was placed from an English-speaking home.

St. Lawrence County's District Attorney Mary Rain said Stephen Howells II, 39, and Nicole Vaisey, 25, both of Hermon, were each charged with two counts of first-degree kidnapping. She said they were in custody awaiting arraignment Friday night and additional charges are possible. Both will have lawyers, but no pleas will be taken or bail granted, the prosecutor said. Rain declined to discuss a motive for the abduction or provide any other specifics about the suspects. She said information provided by the girls helped lead to Howells and Vaisey. The suspects' home is about 13 miles from where the girls live. \"The suspects agreed to go to the sheriff's office to be interviewed earlier today and they were arrested after those interviews,\" Rain said. The sisters vanished Wednesday evening in Oswegatchie, touching off a massive search in the farming community near the Canadian border. They turned up safe Thursday night at the door of a house 15 miles from their home. Authorities had been tight-lipped about details, including what happened to 7-year-old Delila Miller and 12-year-old Fannie Miller while they were missing. And Rain said Friday she would not release more details before a news conference with the county sheriff Saturday morning. Searchers had scoured the farming community of about 4,000 people, in a hunt hampered by a lack of photos of the girls for authorities to circulate. The Amish typically avoid modern technology, and the family had to work with an artist who spoke their language, a German dialect known as Pennsylvania Dutch, to produce a sketch of the older girl. The girls are among the youngest of Mose and Barb Miller's 13 children, who range in age from 1 to 21 years, said neighbor Dot Simmons. The girls routinely took on the chore of selling the fruits, vegetables, jams and other products of the farm and had left the rest of their family during evening milking when they saw the car at the stand. The episode left a sense of vulnerability in a community where residents said even small children often walk unaccompanied to school. \"One thing that comes from this is that people learn this can happen in a small town,\" the prosecutor said. \"I think the public will take precautions, and that's the sad thing.\" Patricia Ritchie, the state senator representing the region, said many are now reluctant to let their children play outdoors unattended.

The Japanese electronics and gaming giant unveiled a prototype virtual reality headset to be used in conjunction with its PlayStation 4 video game console during a Tuesday talk at the Game Developers Conference. Shuhei Yoshida, president of Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios, showed off the slick black-and-white headset at the annual gathering of game designers. He said Sony has been working on the technology for more than three years. The adjustable doodad is codenamed Project Morpheus and features a head-mounted display with 1080p resolution and a 90-degree field of view. Sensors built into the headset can track a wearer's head movement in concert with a PS4 camera. \"This prototype is by no means final,\" said Yoshida. \"We will continue to work on this to improve it, but we believe it's a good representation of how PlayStation will deliver VR.\" Anton Mikhailov, a senior software engineer working on Project Morpheus, said the current version of the technology must be attached to a PS4 console with a cord that's about 15 feet long, and users' virtual perspectives can be simultaneously broadcast on a television screen. \"The experience can be shared, and that's only going to allow it to spread,\" said Mikhailov. \"I think that's going to be the key. Once people see someone else interacting in VR, they're going to want to put it on and try it next.\" Mikhailov said users will be able to interact with the virtual world displayed on the headset with the gesture-detecting PlayStation Move controller, as well as the standard DualShock 4. He declined to specify when the headset would be released or how much it would cost. Project Morpheus will be available for demonstration beginning Wednesday for conference attendees on the conference's expo floor with four games:  diving cage simulator \"The Deep,\" medieval combat game \"The Castle,\" sci-fi dogfighter \"EVE:  Valkyrie\" and a VR rendition of the stealthy action-adventure title \"Thief.\" While Sony Corp. has released other head-mounted display units, Project Morpheus marks the company's first foray into VR with PlayStation. Sony's headset is similar to the Oculus Rift, a VR device currently in development by the Irvine, Calif.-based startup Oculus VR.

Sony, makers of the top-selling PlayStation 4, has rolled out \"Project Morpheus,\" a virtual reality system it says will pair with its top-selling gaming console to immerse players in the virtual worlds in which they're playing. The system, announced Tuesday at the annual Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, joins Oculus Rift, a similar full-immersion VR system that has captured the imaginations of gamers since its $2.4 million debut on Kickstarter in 2012. \"At (Sony Computer Entertainment), we view innovation as an opportunity to build on our mission to push the boundaries of play,\" said Shuhei Yoshida, president of SCE Worldwide Studios, at the conference. \"Project Morpheus is the latest example of innovation from SCE, and we're looking forward to its continued development and the games that will be created as development kits get into the hands of content creators.\" Virtual reality utilizes a headset that gives the wearer a 360-degree field of vision, allowing them to interact with their surroundings as if they were really there. Morpheus will feature a visor-style headset and interact with the camera on the Playstation 4 using sensors that track the player's head movements. Despite a multitude of other dramatic changes through the decades, the way console gamers have interacted with visuals has remained virtually unchanged. The prospect of replacing the static, two-dimensional screen has many in the gaming world anxiously contemplating the possibilities. \"VR is exciting because it thoroughly immerses players in ways not possible on a regular TV set,\" said Dan \"Shoe\" Hsu, a longtime gaming journalist and editor-in-chief of GamesBeat. \"Wherever you turn your head, that's where you'll look, even if it's physically behind you. That sort of 360-degree immersion has never been done in a believable manner in the past, but the technology has caught up. We can now experience the same high graphical fidelity that we see on HDTVs within virtual reality now.\" Sony did not announce a specific timetable or price details for Morpheus, saying models that will be made available to developers are prototypes. It all raises the question of whether top-tier game developers will be willing to make the considerable investment of time and resources it will take to create games for a new, untested system that will only be owned by some gamers who own one particular console. Hsu thinks Sony is in a good position, though. In just three-and-a-half months, the PlayStation 4 has sold more than 6 million units worldwide. \"Not every PS4 owner will buy it, of course,\" he said. \"But because Project Morpheus is essentially a new platform on its own, there will be plenty of developers who will want to be first or early on it. This is a chance for developers to plant their flags in a new market.\" So, what does the arrival of Morpheus mean for Oculus? With Xbox-maker Microsoft also rumored to be working on its own headset, will the independent shop get squeezed by gaming's big names before it even hits the market? Don't count on it. For one, the Oculus Rift is designed to work, primarily, with PCs. So, even if the console makers each develop their own systems, there's plenty of space for the system to thrive despite the competition. And it's got plenty of momentum itself. Oculus has drummed up more than $90 million in funding and, in August, brought in legendary gaming developer John Carmack, the lead programmer behind classic games like \"Doom,\" \"Quake\" and \"Wolfenstein 3D,\" as chief technology officer. \"Oculus is still in a great position with its head start in development, both in hardware and software,\" Hsu said. \"Third-party games have been in the works for the Oculus Rift for quite some time now, so the company is in a good spot for when the headset releases.\" The system got a profile boost at this month's South by Southwest Interactive festival, when it was used for a popular exhibit promoting HBO's \"Game of Thrones.\" \"Competition is always, always good,\" Hsu said. \"If Sony's announcement forces Oculus to be even more aggressive in creating a top-notch VR unit and getting it to market more quickly, then the consumers will benefit.\"", "label": {"what": ["Sony, makers of the top-selling PlayStation 4, has rolled out Project Morpheus,a virtual reality system", "The system, announced Tuesday at the annual Game Developers Conference in San Francisco", "In just three-and-a-half months, the PlayStation 4 has sold more than 6 million units worldwide"], "when": ["Tuesday", "in 2012", "in August"], "where": ["at the annual Game Developers Conference in San Francisco", "at this month's South by Southwest Interactive festival"], "why": ["the way console gamers have interacted with visuals has remained virtually unchanged", "it thoroughly immerses players in ways not possible on a regular TV set", "Project Morpheus is essentially a new platform on its own", "For one, the Oculus Rift is designed to work, primarily, with PCs", "Third-party games have been in the works for the Oculus Rift for quite some time now", "'Competition is always, always good"], "who": ["Sony", "Oculus Rift", "Shuhei Yoshida, president of SCE Worldwide Studios", "Dan Shoe Hsu, a longtime gaming journalist and editor-in-chief of GamesBeat", "gaming developer John Carmack"], "product_name": ["Project Morpheus"], "countermeasures": ["we view innovation as an opportunity to build on our mission to push the boundaries of play"], "new_features": ["gives the wearer a 360-degree field of vision", "feature a visor-style headset and interact with the camera on the Playstation 4 using sensors that track the player's head movements"], "effects": ["the emerging 3D technology many expect to be the next quantum leap in the video gaming world, just got a little more real", "It all raises the question of whether top-tier game developers will be willing to make the considerable investment of time and resources it will take to create games for a new, untested system that will only be owned by some gamers who own one particular console", "'If Sony's announcement forces Oculus to be even more aggressive in creating a top-notch VR unit and getting it to market more quickly, then the consumers will benefit'"]}}
{"text": "Sony has taken the wraps off its PlayStation 4 virtual reality headset at GDC 2014. Shuhei Yoshida wasted little time introducing what everyone had come to see at the \"cryptic\" Sony session. The headset is called Project Morpheus, and it's destined for PS4. Yoshida said this is a prototype that's far from finished, and the company is looking for help from the developer community to \"innovate with us.\" Sony noted it thinks VR as a whole needs to hit six areas to succeed:  sight, sound, tracking, control, ease of use and content. Sony marched through various products and services it already has that set the stage for a successful VR run. For example, its work with PlaySation Move gives it a leg-up when it comes to control (and you can bet Move is tightly integrated with Morpheus). Project Morpheus is 3-plus years in the making, and Yoshida said that the headset is designed to \"push the boundaries of play.\" Since it's a prototype, we weren't treated to a price or a consumer release date. PS4 VR headset specs The dev kit has a few key specs Sony called attention to. The display is 1080p and it has a 90-degree field of view. The Oculus Rift's field of view, by comparison, is approximately 110 degrees diagonally. These sight specs aren't final, but are \"at a stage we can share\" with developers, said Sony's Anton Mikhailov. Tracking is based on PS Move, and the headset uses the same camera as the DualShock 4 and PS Move, Sony said. Both devices can be used to game with Morpheus. It's equipped with positional head tracking, 1,000Hz refresh rate and enables full 360-degree movement.\nHead this way for a complete Project Morpheus spec run down The company is staying tight-lipped about its final spec projections. When asked about its frame rate, latency and a release date, Mikhailov replied, \"highest frame rate we can get, lowest latency we can get and get out as soon as possible.\" He added, \"for as low as we can get.\" As for the name, Yoshida said Sony landed on it last week, which drew laughs from the crowd. Mikhailov elaborated that Morpheus comes from the god of dreams, and the hope is the headset produces another world akin to a dreaming. VR realized Yoshida gave a shout out to Oculus VR during his presentation, and said Sony was inspired by how developers responded to Oculus Rift to push virtual reality forward. The big man at Sony himself acted as a guinea pig for the headset, and he showed a pair of slides in which he was wearing early version of the Project Morpheus. The first, from 2010, was equipped with a Project Move controller. Sony said that it needs the support of the development community to realize the full potential of VR. The company is already working with partners like Unity, Epic, and Havok to develop virtual reality content, and it plans to create a content development and delivery system similar to what it already has in place for PlayStation. Sony's Anton Mikhailov explained that virtual reality could be used for more than just games, such as virtual tourism and interactive media. That being said, he admitted \"games are still the best.\"", "label": {"what": ["Sony has taken the wraps off its PlayStation 4 virtual reality headset at GDC 2014"], "when": ["2014", "from 2010"], "where": ["at GDC"], "why": ["it's a prototype", "Head this way for a complete Project Morpheus spec run down", "realize the full potential of VR", "virtual reality could be used for more than just games, such as virtual tourism and interactive media"], "who": ["Sony", "Shuhei Yoshida", "PlaySation Move", "Sony's Anton Mikhailov", "Oculus Rift"], "product_name": ["Project Morpheus"], "countermeasures": ["the company is looking for help from the developer community to \u2018innovate with us'", "its work with PlaySation Move gives it a leg-up when it comes to control", "Project Morpheus is 3-plus years in the making", "it needs the support of the development community", "The company is already working with partners like Unity, Epic, and Havok to develop virtual reality content, and it plans to create a content development and delivery system similar to what it already has in place for PlayStation"], "new_features": ["it's destined for PS4", "The display is 1080p and it has a 90-degree field of view", "Tracking is based on PS Move, and the headset uses the same camera as the DualShock 4 and PS Move", "It's equipped with positional head tracking, 1,000Hz refresh rate and enables full 360-degree movement", "'highest frame rate we can get, lowest latency we can get and get out as soon as possible'"], "effects": ["Sony marched through various products and services it already has that set the stage for a successful VR run", "push virtual reality forward"]}}
{"text": "San Francisco:  Sony Corp unveiled a prototype for a new virtual reality headset accessory for its Playstation 4 games console at the annual Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, as it bids to further acceptance of the concept. The headset, still in development under the name \"Project Morpheus\", is designed to provide an immersive experience for gamers by projecting a virtual reality image in front of their eyes that shifts as it tracks the movement of their head. Sony has been eager to popularise virtual reality goggles, releasing its first \"personal 3D viewer\" for watching movies in August 2011, but the concept has been slow to catch on among users that rejected it as clunky and gimmicky. However, Project Morpheus marks the first specialist gaming headset from Sony Computer Entertainment, which has been experimenting with the format since 2010. The president of the division, Shuhei Yoshida, said the company was \"encouraged by the enthusiastic response\" to similar products from start-ups like Oculus VR and Valve in recent months. \"This is the culmination of our work for three-plus years and realizes our vision of VR for games,\" said Yoshida at an event at the conference organised by Sony, as he showed off a prototype at a surprise announcement attended by over 350 developers, journalists and game enthusiasts.

Announced by SCE Worldwide Studio's Shuhei Yoshida at GDC 2014, the headset is still a prototype at this stage, even though the black and white design revealed on stage already looks quite slick. In its current form, Project Morpheus packs a 5-inch, 1080p display that gives a 90 degree field of view, plus 360 degree positional head tracking powered by the PlayStation Camera. The headset will also integrate with the PlayStation Move controller, transforming into a virtual object such as a sword in select games. As for audio, Sony claims the headset has \"true spatial sound\" through binaural audio for 3D-like effects, and there's an audio jack on the device so you can bring your own headphones. The edges of Project Morpheus will emit a subtle blue light while in operation (likely for tracking purposes), and the headset is said to be very adjustable and comfortable for prolonged gaming sessions. The current developer kit prototype is wired, connecting to the PlayStation 4 with both HDMI and USB, although a wireless unit isn't off the cards. Sony is already working with several game developers, including Crytek and Epic Games, to develop content for Project Morpheus, but the public unveiling at GDC will hopefully entice several more to hop aboard.

{"text": "TOKYO, March 18, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. (SCE) today announced the development of \"Project Morpheus\" (Morpheus) \" a virtual reality (VR) system that takes the PlayStation4 (PS4\"!) system to the next level of immersion and demonstrates the future of gaming.  SCE will continue development of Morpheus looking towards a future commercial launch. \"At SCE we view innovation as an opportunity to build on our mission to push the boundaries of play,\" said Shuhei Yoshida, President of SCE Worldwide Studios.  \"Project Morpheus is the latest example of innovation from SCE, and we're looking forward to its continued development and the games that will be created as development kits get into the hands of content creators.\" Morpheus enables developers to create experiences that deliver a sense of presence - where players feel as though they are physically inside the virtual world of a game.  Presence is like a window into another world that heightens the emotions gamers experience as they play.  Morpheus features a visor style head-mounted display and works seamlessly with PlayStationCamera to deliver a unique VR experience right before the player's eyes.  Inertial sensors built into the head mount unit and PlayStation Camera accurately track head orientation and movement so as the player's head rotates, the image of the virtual world rotates naturally and intuitively in real-time.  Furthermore, in supporting games, the player can use a PlayStationMove (PS Move) Motion Controller as an object, such as a sword.  Morpheus will reproduce the player's hands and sword within the game so the player feels like they are physically fighting off enemies with their sword in the virtual world. Morpheus adopts 3D audio technology uniquely developed by SCE.  In addition to sounds coming from front, behind, left and right, Morpheus re-creates stereoscopic sounds heard from below and above the players, such as footsteps climbing up stairs below them, or engine noises of helicopters flying overhead.  Sounds that players hear change in real-time depending on their head orientation, creating a highly realistic audio environment within an immersive 360-degree virtual world. Along with PlayStation Camera, Wireless Controller for PS4, and PS Move, Morpheus will deliver immersive breakthrough entertainment experiences to gamers through the PS4 system, leveraging SCE's expertise across key areas for VR   including display/optics, audio, tracking, control, ease of use, and content. Developers will be able to create Morpheus content for PS4, a platform which has sold over 6 million units only after 3 months and a half of its launch, and is continuing to show strong momentum.  The Morpheus dedicated SDK is currently under development and will become available when ready. During the Game Developers Conference 2014 held in San Francisco from March 19 through March 21, attendees can visit the Sony Computer Entertainment America booth to have a hands-on experience with Morpheus, which will be exhibited for reference.  Attendees can enjoy exclusive technology demo such as EVE Valkyrie (CCP), a multiplayer dogfighting shooter that uses virtual reality to give the player the sense of being a real pilot in an EVE Online spaceship, Thief (SQUARE ENIX Co., LTD.), which allows players to explore the dark shadowy world of the stealth action title, \"The Castle\" (SCE) that shows various VR interactions utilizing PS Move, and \"The Deep\" (SCE), where players can observe the waters from inside a shark proof cage.

{"text": "SAN FRANCISCO X Sony is joining the chase for virtual reality, one of the most elusive dreams of the technology industry. At a conference for game developers here Tuesday evening, Sony showed a sleek, white prototype of a headset that is the result of an effort it has code-named Project Morpheus. The headset will give players a high-definition, 3-D view of games that envelops most of their field of vision, along with motion-tracking technology that allows players to pan their view around with the movement of their heads. The headset will connect to Sonys PlayStation 4 game console. Its something which we believe will push the video-game industry forward, Shuhei Yoshida, president of worldwide studios at Sony Computer Entertainment, said at the event. The idea behind Project Morpheus, and similar efforts underway at smaller game companies, is to immerse players more fully in games using with giant television screens that give them the illusion that they are actually in the virtual worlds they see. Technologists have tried to deliver convincing virtual reality experiences for decades, but the technology has been clunky. There is widespread hope in the games business that virtual reality may finally be ready. Many of the critical components inside the latest generation of virtual reality hardware, including high-resolution displays and motion-tracking sensors, are now in abundant supply because of mobile phones, from which they are derived. Much of the buzz around virtual reality in the games business right now is because of a start-up, Oculus VR, that has designed a headset that has pushed the technology forward. The company, which funded the development of its first prototypes through a Kickstarter campaign, added credibility to its efforts when it raised more than $75 million in financing from Andreessen Horowitz and other venture capitalists late last year. The company has sold more than 60,000 of a version of its headset for developers. Oculus VR has not said when it will ship a final version of its product for the public and how much it will cost. Sony withheld similar details about its own virtual-reality product. Mr. Yoshida said that Sony was inspired and encouraged to do its own virtual reality project after the enthusiastic response to the efforts of Oculus VR and Valve, another game company working on the technology. I have enormous respect for them, he said. Sony did not show a demonstration of its headset during the event, but planned to this week at the developer conference. It said one demonstration would give the wearer of the headset the perspective of an underwater diver in a shark cage, while another demonstration would allow them to swing a sword around inside a castle. Richard Marks, who works in research and development at Sony, said he hoped virtual reality would provide a source of creative inspiration for the games business. This is like the wild, wild west, said Dr. Marks. There are no rules.

{"text": "Sony6758.TO +1.50% is joining the hot new field of virtual reality devices in an effort to find a compelling new way to play videogames and differentiate itself from its competitors. At the annual Game Developers Conference in San Francisco on Tuesday, Sony showed off a prototype device V called Project Morpheus V that can be worn to create a virtual reality experience when playing games on its new PlayStation 4 console. Sony said the device, which covers a customers eyes with a screen, creates a unique experience that makes gamers feel more connected to whats going on than if they were playing on a television. Nothing elevates the level of immersion more than VR, Shuhei Yoshida, head of PlayStations videogame software division said at the event. Many of us in PlayStation have dreamed of VR and what it can mean to the games we create. The device will seamlessly integrate with the PlayStation Camera with built-in sensors to track head movement, Sony said. A player can also use the PlayStation Move handheld controller as a sword, for example, and experience the feeling of fighting off enemies in a virtual world. Sony declined to say when the device will be launched, nor how much it would cost. The company also wouldnt say what the final specifications of the product will likely be. Sonys newest effort bolsters the field of virtual reality goggles, which have built-in displays to help convey the effect of entering a simulated world, instead of relying on transparent third-dimensional glasses for viewing a movie or TV screen. Previous to the release of such goggles, virtual reality was largely simulated though a technology known as augmented reality, where game images were layered on top of the real world. Sony had long been rumored to bring its virtual reality headset to the market, but the unveiling of the device comes just as sales of its PS4 consoles have been strong. Sales have topped 6 million units worldwide since its launch in November. The Japanese tech giant is betting on its gaming division to drive sales at a time when its once-revered electronics businesses are struggling. The company expects an annual loss of $1.1 billion, weighed down by costs to fix its television and personal computer businesses. In the past, Sony has experimented with 3-D technology. At various times, it has sold games for the PlayStation that support 3-D images, and it has even sold a PlayStation-branded 3D TV. The company also sells a Personal 3D Viewer headset, which it says works both as a way to watch TV and to play videogames. It costs $1,000. Today, the most visible virtual reality headset maker is Oculus VR, a startup from Irvine, Calif. That company, which unveiled its Rift goggles two years ago, has since become a magnet for eager developers. Various videogame accessories makers have begun creating products that incorporate the companys product, as have several videogame developers. Oculus still hasnt said when its product will hit retail store shelves. Brendan Iribe, chief executive of Oculus VR, said hes not particularly worried about increased competition. He added that Oculus has been able to hire well-known developers from the videogame industry, such as Doom creator John Carmack. A larger concern, he said, was that he hopes any companies offering competing products focus on good customer experiences. We hope big companies take the time thats required to do it right, he said. Analysts say Sonys entry into the field could help to bring virtual reality headsets closer to the mainstream. Building such devices that meet consumer expectations has also become easier with advancement in computer, graphics and display technologies, says Brian Blau, research director in consumer technologies at Gartner. Still, Blau says Sonys VR system, when it does hit the market, will likely be limited to hard-core gamers already owning PS4 consoles in the initial phase. If they want mass adoption, theyd have to make it as cheap as they can. The consumer electronics industry has been chasing 3-D visuals and virtual reality products for decades. Films made with 3-D and viewed through specialized glasses are now commonly shown in movie theaters. But the success of these movies hasnt translated to TVs. Analysts say customers are more accepting of bulky headwear necessary to create the optical illusions in movie theaters, rather than in the home. Nintendo has had what is likely the most contentious relationship with the technology. In the early 1990s, it developed a product called Virtual Boy, a headset that displayed 3-D images. But the visuals were more simplistic than customers were used to. Reception was so poor that it was pulled off shelves after a year. The company tried again with its 3DS handheld in 2012, offering three-dimensional images without the need for specialized glasses. Customers were still slow to catch on, however, and the device only began gaining traction when Nintendo7974.TO -1.20% cut the price as much as 40% and released a bevy of new games. Microsoft as well has also tested various virtual reality products, but has yet to release any. Naoki Yoshida, the director and producer for Square Enixs latest Final Fantasy franchise game, said hes turned down opportunities to work on virtual reality products so far because he isnt convinced theyll become a mass-market trend. It is exciting and has potential for great gameplay, but will it be a good business and source of revenue yet? We dont know, he said through a translator. Yoshida said historically, add-on products and peripherals dont tend to do very well and only sell to a fraction of customers. That reduces potential reach for his companys games, he added. If it had been included in the hardware at launch, I would have considered making a game for it, he said. But, he said, its reasonable for hardware makers to explore new types of gameplay, particularly considering expectations that the industry may not grow much in the next several years. The only thing that may induce growth is a brand new experience thats different from previously provided, he said.", "label": {"what": ["At the annual Game Developers Conference in San Francisco on Tuesday, Sony showed off a prototype device V called Project Morpheus V", "Sony declined to say when the device will be launched, nor how much it would cost.

More than one million individuals are estimated to have been poached from the wild over the past decade, which makes pangolins the most illegally traded mammal in the world, warns the IUCN Species Survival Commission (SSC) Pangolin Specialist Group. Despite a commercial trade ban for wild-caught pangolins in Asia, the illegal trade is thriving.

Now, conservationists warn that pangolins, or scaly anteaters, could be eaten out of existence if illegal hunting and poaching continue. In the latest update of the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species, all eight pangolin species were listed as \"critically endangered,\" \"endangered\" or \"vulnerable.\" Today (July 29), a group of scientists and conservationists tasked with studying pangolins for the IUCN issued an action plan outlining steps that should be taken to save the armored, insect-eating creatures. \"In the 21st century, we really should not be eating species to extinction  there is simply no excuse for allowing this illegal trade to continue,\" Jonathan Baillie, co-chair of the pangolin specialist group for the IUCN's Species Survival Commission and conservation programs director at the Zoological Society of London, said in a statement. [See Photos of Pangolins at Risk] Pangolins, native to Asia and Africa, are the world's only mammals with true scales made of keratin. Despite international trade bans, pangolin meat and scales still fetch high prices on the black market. Demand is especially high in China and Vietnam, where pangolin parts are used in medicine and served as a culinary delicacy. Last August, more than six tons of live pangolins were seized as they headed from Indonesia to Vietnam in a shipping container labeled as frozen fish, fins and fish bones, AFP reported at the time. In April 2013, a Chinese fishing vessel was found carrying as many as 2,000 of the toothless creatures, after the vessel ran aground in the protected Tubbataha Reefs off the coast of the Philippines, according to the World Wildlife Fund. Though the scope of the black market is difficult to quantify, conservationists estimate that more than 1 million pangolins have been taken from the wild in just the last decade. The four species in Asia are the most severely threatened. The Chinese pangolin and the Sunda pangolin are now considered critically endangered, while the Indian pangolin and Philippine pangolin are now listed as endangered. But as the populations of Asian pangolin species are becoming more scarce, traders are increasingly looking to Africa to meet the demand for pangolin. Dan Challender, co-chair of the pangolin specialist group, has witnessed that demand firsthand. In 2012, just a few days after he arrived in Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam, Challender said he watched a man in a restaurant drop the equivalent of about $700 U.S. to have a  4.4-pound (2 kilograms) live pangolin killed and served to him. As pangolin meat is often the most expensive item on a menu in Vietnam, businessmen and women might order it to celebrate the signing of a contract or deal, or to impart status, Challender said. While recent studies have indicated that delicacies like shark fin soup are losing their status, Challender suspects conservationists have a long way to go in changing public opinion about consuming pangolins. \"Pangolins are a group of species that are arguably forgotten in the conservation movement,\" Challender told Live Science. \"They're nowhere near as visible as other animals like tigers and rhinos.\" The steps outlined in the action plan involve protecting pangolin strongholds in Asia and Africa, and developing a price index to track the demand of pangolin meat and scales on the market. The pangolin specialist group also recommends that scientists conduct more studies to better understand the creatures' range, movement and distribution in the wild. The group has also called for programs to help local communities move away from poaching and ensure that they have alternatives to poaching pangolins to make a living; for some people, finding a pangolin in a remote part of Southeast Asia is still \"a bit like a finding a winning lottery ticket,\" Challender said.", "label": {"what": ["described as walking artichokes and the most trafficked mammals in the world", "pangolins, or scaly anteaters, could be eaten out of existence if illegal hunting and poaching continue", "all eight pangolin species were listed as \u2018critically endangered,' \u2018endangered' or \u2018vulnerable'", "the world's only mammals with true scales made of keratin"], "when": ["Today (July 29)", "In the 21st century", "Last August", "In April 2013", "In 2012"], "where": ["Asia and Africa", "in China and Vietnam", "from Indonesia to Vietnam", "in the protected Tubbataha Reefs off the coast of the Philippines", "in Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam"], "why": ["there is simply no excuse for allowing this illegal trade to continue", "pangolin meat and scales still fetch high prices on the black market", "pangolin parts are used in medicine and served as a culinary delicacy", "the populations of Asian pangolin species are becoming more scarce", "pangolin meat is often the most expensive item on a menu in Vietnam", "'Pangolins are a group of species that are arguably forgotten in the conservation movement'"], "who": ["pangolins, or scaly anteaters", "Jonathan Baillie, co-chair of the pangolin specialist group for the IUCN's Species Survival Commission and conservation programs director at the Zoological Society of London", "World Wildlife Fund", "Dan Challender, co-chair of the pangolin specialist group"], "countermeasures": ["an action plan outlining steps that should be taken to save the armored, insect-eating creatures", "conservationists have a long way to go in changing public opinion about consuming pangolins", "The steps outlined in the action plan involve protecting pangolin strongholds in Asia and Africa, and developing a price index to track the demand of pangolin meat and scales on the market", "called for programs to help local communities move away from poaching and ensure that they have alternatives to poaching pangolins to make a living"], "threats": ["eating species to extinction", "more than 1 million pangolins have been taken from the wild in just the last decade.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature Species Survival Commission (IUCN) says the pangolin is the most illegally traded animal in the world. The extinction of the scaly anteater-like creatures is fueled by Asia's dinner tables; in Vietnam, China and other parts of East Asia, the creature is highly prized for its meat, while it's keratin scales are important in traditional Chinese medicine. Until this week, only seven of the eight pangolin species were threatened. But the last so-called safe species, the African ground pangolin, was downgraded from \"least threatened\" to \"vulnerable.\" The toothless scaled animals that roll into balls resemble anteaters, and though they're not as closely related to anteaters and sloths as once thought, they do use their long sticky tongue to dine mostly on ants and termites. They range in size -- depending on species -- from 3.5 pounds to about 73 pounds. The giant species stretches up to five feet in length. With Asia's supply of pangolins running low, black market traders and poachers have moved on to Africa. Only days ago, customs officials raided a boat arriving in Vietnam from Sierra Leone. Inside was 1.4 tons of dried pangolin scales, harvested from some 10,000 dead pangolin. \"In the 21st Century we really should not be eating species to extinction -- there is simply no excuse for allowing this illegal trade to continue,\" said Professor Jonathan Baillie, a pangolin advocate with IUCN and director of conservation programming at the Zoological Society of London. \"A first vital step is for the Chinese and Vietnamese governments to conduct an inventory of their pangolin scale stocks and make this publicly available to prove that wild-caught pangolins are no longer supplying the commercial trade,\" said Baillie's colleague Dan Challender.

But pangolin scales also seem to induce something far less beneficial:  rapacity. A recent report from the International Union for Conservation of Nature, or IUCN, warns that the pangolin is \"literally being eaten out of existence.\" Demand not just for scales but also for pangolin meat in East and Southeast Asia has produced a thriving illegal pangolin market. All eight species of pangolin are threatened by extinction, with two critically endangered. And unlike many other endangered species, whose relatively small habitats are threatened by urbanization, pangolin can be found over a wide swath of the planet:  practically all of South and Southeast Asia and much of sub-Saharan Africa. So why the sudden rapacious appetite for pangolin? Dan Challender, who co-chairs IUCN's Pangolin Specialist Group, says that in recent years \"the dynamic of [pangolin] consumption has changed.\" Once a supplemental protein source for people in rural villages, it has become a luxury food for newly rich urbanites, prized precisely because it must be caught in the wild. \"In Vietnam and China,\" Challender says, \"wild meat is considered very good. It's treated differently from farmed meat. ... It's a natural product. There's an attachment to it.\" This distinguishes pangolin from shark fin, for instance  a traditional luxury food that became more widely consumed as more people could afford luxuries. Pangolin consumption seems driven by both urban nostalgie de la boue (the same thing that makes it impossible to swing a handmade banjo in Brooklyn without hitting a farm-to-table restaurant), and by its rarity. IUCN has come up with an admirably broad plan to halt pangolins' slide into extinction by trying to stem both supply and demand. The former is well-intentioned and politically necessary, but may be a waste of time. China and Vietnam are already signatories to CITES, an international treaty that on paper (and apparently only on paper) prohibits trade in endangered species. That has not stopped the trade in tigers, rhinos, or, for that matter, pangolins. The action is on the demand side, which is much trickier:  Getting governments to sign a popular treaty is easy; changing the behavior of millions of status-conscious consumers is much harder. But it's not impossible. An anti-shark-fin campaign run by WWF's Hong Kong chapter names corporations that refuse to serve shark-fin soup at their events and also lists caterers who provide fin-free banquets. WWF-HK claims that the volume of shark fin imported into Hong Kong declined by nearly 35 percent from 2012 to 2013. China began a three-year phase-out of shark fin at its state banquets; it too has avowed a dramatic drop in shark-fin sales. Pangolins are often consumed as business deals are made. Challender suggests that one promising approach would be to get a large corporation to forswear wild-meat consumption during contract signings. The IUCN also calls for digital-media campaigns, engaging foundations in pangolin-conservation and engaging \"the arts community to promote the plight of pangolins.\" Let me offer a poem:  \"That's a pangolin/Don't stuff it in/Your mouth.\" Jon Fasman is The Economist's Southeast Asia bureau chief.

{"text": "In many places, its illegal to buy or eat the pangolin, A.K.A. the scaly anteater, but people in many places do it anyway. The pangolin is a small creature, about a foot to three feet long, that eats ants and termites and lives a mostly solitary nocturnal life. Eight species of pangolin are still around, though two of them are critically endangered, and more have already died out. According to folklore, its scales, which are made of keratin  the same stuff thats in our hair and nails  can supposedly purify the blood, fix womens hormonal problems, and debloat the body. Some people also think eating them can cure cancer and asthma. For the pangolin, the scales serve as armor against predators. As a defense mechanism, it rolls up in a ball, and wild animals cant get to it. But its got no way to protect itself from humans. Theres a huge illegal market in Vietnam and China for pangolin meat, which is eaten by some rich people who see it as an exotic luxury good. In Southeast Asia, its often brought out in celebration as business deals are finalized. The pangolin is also hunted and used for meat in parts of Africa, and as it becomes more and more rare in Asia, people are trafficking it across borders to make up for the scarcity. No ones sure how many pangolins are left in the wild, but if its killed at this rate, all eight species of the mammal could die out, says a new report from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). According to the report, the pangolin is literally being eaten out of existence. Back in the day, pangolin was a useful source of protein for people who lived near its natural, wild habitat. Today in Asia, according to Dan Challender of IUCN in an interview with NPR, thats the same reason its so desirable:  its not easy to get. Before the pangolin can die out forever, IUCN is working on two fronts to save them. First, theyre concentrating on supply, and secondly, theyre working to reduce demand. Though the governments of China and Vietnam already prohibit sales of these endangered creatures, the laws are really just for show. The trades happen anyway. So its going to be hard to make a difference through policy. But decreasing demand could do the trick. Getting people to start seeing pangolin as a living creature, not a delicacy, will be tough  but it will make a big difference. If people quit eating it, eventually vendors will stop hunting and trying to sell pangolin, legally or not. Even if you dont eat meat, you can make a difference by raising awareness for the pangolins plight, and helping others understand what will happen if they dont make a change. The pangolins fate is in our hands. Can we make up for the destruction weve caused it?", "label": {"what": ["The pangolin is a small creature, about a foot to three feet long, that eats ants and termites and lives a mostly solitary nocturnal life", "Eight species of pangolin are still around, though two of them are critically endangered, and more have already died out", "For the pangolin, the scales serve as armor against predators.

{"text": "AUSTIN, Texas (AP)  Attorneys for indicted Republican Texas Gov. Rick Perry formally asked a judge Monday to dismiss felony charges alleging that the possible 2016 presidential candidate abused his power with a veto last summer. In a 60-page motion filed in state district court in Austin, Perry's high-powered defense team argues that the law being used to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutionally vague. They go on to claim that \"attempts to convert inescapably political disputes into criminal complaints\" shouldn't be allowed to go forward. Since being indicted on two felony counts more than a week ago, Perry has emphatically rejected the charges as a political ploy and pleaded not guilty. Perry is accused of leveraging his veto power in June 2013 to try to oust a Democratic district attorney who was convicted of drunken driving. \"Texans deserve what their State's constitution guarantees:  a Governor with the power to approve or disapprove of bills,\" reads the filing. The filing was not unexpected. While Perry was in New Hampshire on Friday continuing his courtship of GOP voters for another potential White House run, one of his attorneys said the motion was imminent following a meeting in Austin with the Republican judge overseeing the case. Michael McCrum, the special prosecutor, emerged from that meeting saying he remained confident in the charges. Perry cut off $7.5 million in state funds to the unit  which prosecutes public corruption in Texas  when Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg refused to resign following her drunken driving arrest. Perry is charged with violating a section of state corruption laws that his attorneys argue \"is fatally vague and overbroad\" and doesn't define what actions are legal on one hand and illegal on the other. He is charged with abuse of official capacity and coercion of a public servant. If convicted, Perry could face a maximum 109 years in prison. Perry's 2012 presidential campaign ended badly after he made several missteps, and he told business leaders in New Hampshire last week that he has yet to decide whether he will run again in 2016.", "label": {"what": ["Attorneys for indicted Republican Texas Gov.

{"text": "AUSTIN >> Lawyers for Gov. Rick Perry on Monday asked that statues under which the governor was charged earlier this month be declared unconstitutional  at least insofar as they're being applied to Perry. The lawyers filed a 60-page writ of habeas corpus arguing that the governor's two-count felony indictment violates several parts of the U.S. and Texas constitutions. Perry is accused of coercion and misusing government property last year by vetoing funding for the Public Integrity Unit in the Travis County District Attorney's office if District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, a Democrat, didn't resign. Perry says Lehmberg's DWI arrest was his reason for wanting her gone, but some opponents say he wanted her out so he could appoint her replacement, who would be in charge of Public Integrity Unit. That office has the power to investigate state government, including the governor's office. Perry's two-page indictment was presented to a Travis County Grand Jury by Special Prosecutor Michael McCrum. Critics have said it is too vague to justify the indictment of a sitting governor. The writ filed on Monday makes that argument, too, saying the statutes themselves fail to make clear what conduct is prohibited, so they're too vague to be constitutional. But even if they're not too vague, it says, \"the facts as alleged by the state still fail to set forth any violations of these statutes.\" At Perry's arraignment last week, McCrum said he would not detail his case in the press, but in pleadings to the court. The first of these will be a response to Perry's writ, which seeks to have the case thrown out and future prosecution barred. The document argues that in issuing last year's veto of $7.5 million for the Public Integrity Unit, Perry was acting in a legislative capacity even though he's governor. It did not admit that Perry had threatened Lehmberg with the veto if she didn't quit, but it said that even if Perry did make such a threat, it was protected under the Speech or Debate Clause of the Texas Constitution, among other protections. \"Allowing a criminal prosecution of a political decision where there is no allegation of bribery or demonstrable corruption undermines the basic structure of state government,\" the writ says. It later adds, \"The normal 'give and take' of the legislative process in dealing with the departments and agencies of state government, and in dealing with other members of the legislative branch, would, were this law be applied as written, give way to a rigid, silent formalism in the legislative process  cast your votes yea or nay, without complaint, explanation or negotiation, or risk going to prison.\" The pleading filed Monday says that Perry will file a motion to quash the indictment if the writ of habeas corpus is unsuccessful. The writ said it's essential for Perry and future governors that the case be dismissed quickly. \"Unlike the ordinary case, the mere pendency of judicial proceedings is what imperils the constitutional principles at stake; the separation of powers is not threatened by a conviction, but by injecting judicial scrutiny into a political dispute,\" it says.

{"text": "The two-count indictment against Gov. Rick Perry defies common sense and should be dismissed immediately if not sooner as a violation of the U.S. and Texas constitutions, Perrys legal team told the trial judge Monday. The wide-ranging attack argued that Perrys criminal charges were based on state laws that are unconstitutional or, at the very least, were misinterpreted  constituting an improper attempt to criminalize politics and limit gubernatorial power in intolerable and incalculable ways. Continued prosecution of Governor Perry on the current indictment is unprecedented, insupportable and simply impermissible, said the 60-page filing by defense lawyer David Botsford. The charges, stemming from Perrys veto last year of state money for the Travis County district attorneys office, also violate the Texas Constitutions separation-of-powers clause by improperly inserting the courts into the functions of the executive and legislative branches, the petition said. Allowing a criminal prosecution of a political decision where there is no allegation of bribery or demonstrable corruption undermines the basic structure of state government, Botsford wrote. It is no fault of the court that it has been asked to intrude on a political dispute; dismissal is the proper way to ensure that the judiciary plays no part in the separation-of-powers attack. The document filed Monday was a petition for a writ of habeas corpus  designed for constitutional challenges but rarely filed before a trial. Special prosecutor Michael McCrum will be given time to respond  no deadline has been set  and Senior District Judge Bert Richardson can schedule a hearing to gather additional evidence or rule based on the legal briefs. Either way, the losing side can  and most likely will  appeal Richardsons decision to the 3rd Court of Appeals in Austin, which is comprised of five Republican justices and one Democrat. The Court of Criminal Appeals, with an 8-1 advantage in Republican judges, also can be asked to review the 3rd Courts decision. Even with a request for expedited rulings, the appellate court process will take weeks, probably months, to navigate. If Mondays petition fails to void the criminal charges against Perry, Botsford indicated that he will file a motion to dismiss the indictments for failure to adequately state a violation of state law. Those arguments will not be addressed now, because pretrial habeas corpus is not the remedy for factual inadequacy, even when that inadequacy is as blatant as it is here, Botsford told Richardson in the petition. A Travis County grand jury indicted Perry 10 days ago on felony charges of coercion of a public servant and abuse of official capacity. He is accused of threatening to withhold $7.5 million in state money to the Public Integrity Unit unless District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg resigned after her high-profile arrest for drunken driving.

{"text": "AUSTIN Texas (Reuters) - Attorneys for Texas Governor Rick Perry filed a motion on Monday to dismiss two felony charges of abusing his power, saying it is unjust to prosecute the leader of the state over a political dispute by trying to criminalize a veto. Perry, a possible candidate in the 2016 Republican presidential race, was indicted earlier this month for trying to use the veto to force the resignation of a prosecutor in Travis County, a Democratic stronghold in the Republican-dominated state. \"Subjecting any sitting governor to a criminal prosecution and injecting the judiciary into a political dispute would be an unprecedented assault on this cherished separation of powers,\" the motion filed in a Travis County district court said. Perry, the longest-serving governor in the state's history, became the target of an ethics investigation last year after he vetoed $7.5 million in funding for the state public integrity unit run from the Travis County district attorney's office. His veto was widely viewed as intended to force the ouster of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, a Democrat, after she had pleaded guilty to drunken driving and remained in office. He was charged with abuse of official capacity, a first-degree felony, and coercion of a public official, a third-degree felony. Perry has called the charges politically motivated. His critics contend he wanted to dictate the public integrity unit's actions, allowing cronyism to fester in his administration. Perry has sought to parlay attention over the indictment into a fresh political push, making speeches last week in the crucial presidential primary state of New Hampshire, where his dismal showing in 2012 led him to drop out of the presidential race. Perry, who in surveys of Republicans has ranked among the bottom of possible presidential primary candidates, has portrayed himself as the victim of a partisan political prosecution. Cal Jillson, a professor of political science at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, said Perry needs to avoid going to trial because the court proceeding could prove damaging, especially if a parade of his operatives testify about the political dealings that went into the veto. \"Unless his lawyers can get the indictment quashed, get the indictment thrown out by a judge before the trial begins, the trial will kill him as a candidate for the Republican nomination in 2016,\" Jillson said.", "label": {"what": ["Attorneys for Texas Governor Rick Perry filed a motion on Monday to dismiss two felony charges of abusing his power", "became the target of an ethics investigation last year after he vetoed $7.5 million in funding for the state public integrity unit run from the Travis County district attorney's office"], "when": ["on Monday", "in 2016", "in 2012"], "where": ["AUSTIN Texas", "in Travis County", "New Hampshire", "at Southern Methodist University in Dallas"], "why": ["dismiss two felony charges of abusing his power", "it is unjust to prosecute the leader of the state over a political dispute by trying to criminalize a veto", "the court proceeding could prove damaging"], "who": ["Texas Governor Rick Perry", "Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, a Democrat", "Cal Jillson, a professor of political science"], "charges": ["was indicted earlier this month for trying to use the veto to force the resignation of a prosecutor in Travis County, a Democratic stronghold in the Republican-dominated state", "He was charged with abuse of official capacity, a first-degree felony, and coercion of a public official, a third-degree felony"], "plead": ["dismiss two felony charges of abusing his power", "Perry has called the charges politically motivated", "Perry has sought to parlay attention over the indictment into a fresh political push", "has portrayed himself as the victim of a partisan political prosecution"], "sentence": ["Unless his lawyers can get the indictment quashed, get the indictment thrown out by a judge before the trial begins, the trial will kill him as a candidate for the Republican nomination in 2016"]}}

{"text": "AUSTIN  Lawyers for Rick Perry urged a judge Monday to dismiss the charges against him as an unconstitutional attack that would limit the governors powers and criminalize politics. The 60-page brief describes the felony charges  abuse of office and coercion of a public official  as overly broad statutes that, at the least, have been wrongly construed. Continued prosecution of Gov. Perry on the current indictment is unprecedented, insupportable and simply impermissible, the brief states. In a kitchen-sink approach, lawyers are asking Judge Bert Richardson to declare the coercion statute unconstitutionally vague and recognize Perrys conduct as protected. They also argue that courts cannot, under separation of powers, impose a judgment on a governors official acts. Special prosecutor Michael McCrum will have an opportunity to respond to the challenge before the court rules on the motion. McCrum did not comment Monday but has said that he is confident that the charges are supportable and will go forward. Perry is charged with attempting to coerce Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg into quitting her post by threatening to veto $7.5 million for her office. He has said her April 2013 drunken-driving conviction and actions led him to lose confidence in her leadership. The indictment alleges that Perry violated the law by linking money to attempting to force Lehmberg into taking an action. In the brief, Perrys attorneys strike at least three major themes:  that the definition of coercion is so broad that no one could know in advance that they are violating a statute; that political disputes are widely protected; and that Perry had a legal right to do everything of which he is accused. The lawyers say the governor was within his free-speech rights to assail Lehmberg and call on her to quit. Core political speech, such as the veto and alleged veto threat at issue in this case, lies at the very heart of First Amendment protection, the brief states. The lawyers argued that such horse-trading is common in the Legislature and to label it coercion would criminalize many legislative actions. It fails to give reasonable notice to any official about what is permissible conduct on the one hand and felonious on the other. The prosecutors literal interpretation of coercion would subject members of the House and Senate to criminal exposure when they negotiate with each other in resolving difference at conference committee meetings, the brief stated. The brief also calls attention to a 1990 case involving Bosque County Judge Regina Hanson, who threatened  unless the county auditor was fired and a persons probation revoked  to cut the salaries of the deputy district clerk and assistant district attorney.

{"text": "(CNN) -- Texas Gov. Rick Perry added another high-powered lawyer to his team fighting a felony indictment against him, but this addition is just as much about sending a message than winning the case. Mark Fabiani has deep ties to the Democratic Party and is best known for his legal and crisis communication expertise. He guided President Bill Clinton in his White House years and also ran Al Gore's communications team during his presidential run in 2000. As Fabiani signed on, Perry's defense filed papers in Travis County District Court requesting the indictment be dismissed, arguing the charges are based on \"unconstitutional\" statute. Perry, a potential 2016 Republican presidential candidate, has been charged with coercion of a public servant and abuse of his official capacity. They involve his threat last year to veto funding for a program run by the district attorney in Austin, Rosemary Lehmberg. The Travis County Democrat had been charged with drunken driving and refused to resign. While Fabiani's ability to navigate crisis communications will be useful to the Republican politician, Perry's reputation is on the line as he is simultaneously laying the foundation for a possible second White House bid. Perry's team approached Fabiani about working on the case, and he accepted because \"this case raises very significant First Amendment issues,\" he told CNN. His hire is another attempt to show that even Democrats think the charges against Perry are ridiculous. \"I'm proud to join Governor Perry's outstanding team which has been assembled to fight back against this attack on the rule of law,\" Fabiani said in a statement. \"I am confident this prosecution will be revealed to be contrary to the law and wholly meritless.\" The Harvard-educated lawyer will be on the same team as Ben Ginsberg, a sharp departure from 14 years ago when the two were on opposite sides of the Florida presidential recount that sent George W. Bush to the White House. Ginsberg worked for Bush, and Fabiani for Gore, then the vice president. Leading Perry's defense is Tony Buzbee, a Texas trial lawyer whose bio is 25 paragraphs long and includes media references like this one:  \"The New York Times stated it best when it described Buzbee like this:  'Mr. Buzbee is a big, mean, ambitious, tenacious, fire-breathing Texas trial lawyer. Really big. Poster boy big.'\" Perry has said he acted lawfully and indicated the charges were political. \"I refer to Travis County as the blueberry in the tomato soup if you know what I mean,\" Perry said in New Hampshire Friday, referring to the liberal-leaning political views in the Austin area, compared to other parts of the reliably red state.", "label": {"what": ["Texas Gov.

{"text": "AUSTIN, Tex.  Defense lawyers for Gov. Rick Perry of Texas on Monday sought to throw out a felony abuse-of-power case against him, calling it an unconstitutional prosecution that would set a dangerous precedent for future governors. The motion was the first legal filing in what has largely been a public relations offensive waged by Mr. Perry and his defense team to cast the two-count indictment as an outrageous political assault. The indictment, returned by a grand jury in Travis County just over a week ago, stems from Mr. Perrys efforts to force the resignation of the countys district attorney, Rosemary Lehmberg, after she was arrested on drunken-driving charges in April 2013. Mr. Perry is charged with threatening to veto funding to the offices anticorruption unit unless she quit, a threat that he ultimately carried out with a veto that blocked $7.5 million in state money. In their motion, Mr. Perrys lawyers asked Judge Bert Richardson, a Republican, to bar the prosecution by dismissing what they called a fatally defective indictment. The filing was 60 pages long, including attachments, and was signed by David L. Botsford of Austin, one of Mr. Perrys five lawyers. The lawyers said that the indictment seeks to criminalize a governors veto power, which they called a key limitation on legislative power and an integral component in the checks and balances between the branches of government. Subjecting any sitting governor to a criminal prosecution and injecting the judiciary into a political dispute would be an unprecedented assault on this cherished separation of powers and would impose an intolerable and incalculable chilling effect on the free exercise of legitimate constitutional powers by future governors, the lawyers declared. The special prosecutor, Michael McCrum, is expected to file a response to the motion before a Friday deadline. Mr. McCrum, a San Antonio lawyer, told reporters that he would review the defense motion and prepare a written response, and that if the court calls for a hearing, I will appear in court and argue on behalf of the people of the State of Texas.", "label": {"what": ["Defense lawyers for Gov.

{"text": "AUSTIN, Texas -- Attorneys for indicted Republican Texas Gov. Rick Perry formally asked a judge Monday to dismiss felony charges alleging that the possible 2016 presidential candidate abused his power with a veto last summer. In a 60-page motion filed in state district court in Austin, Perry's high-powered defense team argues that the law being used to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutionally vague. They go on to claim that \"attempts to convert inescapably political disputes into criminal complaints\" shouldn't be allowed to go forward. Since being indicted on two felony counts more than a week ago, Perry has emphatically rejected the charges as a political ploy, often pointing to liberal pundits who have vocally questioned the charges. After turning himself in last Tuesday for booking and a mug shot, he pleaded \"not guilty\" to the charges. Perry is accused of leveraging his veto power in June 2013 to try to oust a Democratic district attorney who was convicted of drunken driving. \"Texans deserve what their State's constitution guarantees:  a Governor with the power to approve or disapprove of bills,\" reads the filing. The filing was not unexpected. While Perry was in New Hampshire on Friday continuing his courtship of GOP voters for another potential White House run, one of his attorneys said the motion was imminent following a meeting in Austin with the Republican judge overseeing the case. Michael McCrum, the special prosecutor, emerged from that meeting saying he remained confident in the charges. Meanwhile, Perry has added an additional attorney to his high-powered legal team, CBS News has confirmed:  Mark Fabiani, a former special counsel to former President Bill Clinton and deputy campaign manager for then-Vice President Al Gore during his 2000 presidential campaign. In a twist, that puts Fabiani on the same team as Ben Ginsberg, former President George W. Bush's lawyer during the Supreme Court case that decided the 2000 election. Ginsberg is also representing Perry. \"I'm proud to join Gov. Perry's outstanding team which has been assembled to fight back against this attack on the rule of law,\" Fabiani said in a statement. \"As we move forward to protect the Texas Constitution and the First Amendment rights of any governor, I am confident this prosecution will be revealed to be contrary to the law and wholly meritless.\" The governor cut off $7.5 million in state funds to the unit - which prosecutes public corruption in Texas - when Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg refused to resign following her drunken driving arrest. Perry is charged with violating state laws related to bribery and corruption. His attorneys argue in the filing that the section of the law \"is fatally vague and overbroad\" and doesn't define what actions are legal on one hand and illegal on the other. He is charged with abuse of official capacity and coercion of a public servant. If convicted, Perry could face a maximum 109 years in prison. Perry's 2012 presidential campaign ended badly after he made several missteps, and he told business leaders in New Hampshire last week that he has yet to decide whether he will run again in 2016. If he does, he promised to be more prepared than he was in 2012. \"I've spent a lot of time in preparation,\" he said. \"That's not to say I've made a decision I'm going to run. I haven't. But the reason I don't choose to run will not be because I'm ill-prepared.\" Perry's allies say that the legal charges have actually helped, not hurt him, and several high-profile Republicans who he might face in a 2016 nomination fight have backed him. His adviser in New Hampshire, Mike Dennehy, told CBS News last week that the number of people who signed up to attend a rally with him went \"through the roof\" after the indictment.", "label": {"what": ["Attorneys for indicted Republican Texas Gov.

{"text": "An international team of scientists studying Emperor penguin populations across Antarctica finds the iconic animals in danger of dramatic declines by the end of the century due to climate change. Their study, published today in Nature Climate Change, finds the Emperor penguin \"fully deserving of endangered status due to climate change.\" The Emperor penguin is currently under consideration for inclusion under the US Endangered Species Act. Criteria to classify species by their extinction risk are based on the global population dynamics. The study was conducted by lead author Stephanie Jenouvrier, a biologist with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), and colleagues at the Centre d'Etudes Biologiques de Chiz (French Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique), the National Center for Atmospheric Research, the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, and the University of Amsterdam. Emperor penguins are heavily dependent on sea ice for their livelihoods, and, therefore, are sensitive to changes in sea ice concentration (SIC). The researchers' analysis of the global, continent-wide Emperor penguin population incorporates current and projected future SIC declines, and determined that all of the colonies would be in decline -- many by more than 50 percent -- by the end of the century, due to future climate change. \"If sea ice declines at the rates projected by the IPCC climate models, and continues to influence Emperor penguins as it did in the second half of the 20th century in Terre Adlie, at least two-thirds of the colonies are projected to have declined by greater than 50 percent from their current size by 2100,\" said Jenouvrier. \"None of the colonies, even the southern-most locations in the Ross Sea, will provide a viable refuge by the end of 21st century.\" The foundation for the research is a 50-year intensive study of the Emperor penguin colony in Terre Adlie, in eastern Antarctica, supported by the French Polar Institute (IPEV) and Zone Atelier Antarctique (LTER France). Researchers have been returning to Terre Adlie every year to collect biological measurements of the penguins there, charting the population's growth (and decline), and observing their mating, foraging, chick-rearing patterns, and following marked individuals from year to year. \"Long-term studies like this are invaluable for measuring the response of survival and breeding to changes in sea ice. They provide our understanding of the role sea ice plays in the emperor penguin's life cycle,\" said Hal Caswell, a scientist emeritus at WHOI and professor at the University of Amsterdam. \"The role of sea ice is complicated,\" added Jenouvrier. \"Too much ice requires longer trips for penguin parents to travel to the ocean to hunt and bring back food for their chicks. But too little ice reduces the habitat for krill, a critical food source for emperor penguins. Our models take into account both the effects of too much and too little sea ice in the colony area.\" The data from Terre Adlie were an essential component of two earlier studies by Jenouvrier, Caswell, and their team:  a 2009 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Science and a more detailed 2012 study in Global Change Biology that showed the Terre Adlie population was likely to decline by 80 percent by the end of the century. The new study expands on that work, by using the previous population models to project how all of Antarctica's 45 known colonies will respond to future climate change. Those projections are based on the current SIC at each location and on changes in SIC at each location, projected by the best available climate models. Those models, part of the IPCC effort, incorporate the physical processes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and land surfaces. The researchers found that, while some colonies will increase for a while, this growth is short-lived. By the end of the century at least two-thirds of them will have declined by more than half. Of even more concern, all of the colonies are projected to be declining by that time. Although current climate models do not look further into the future than that, a dramatic change would be required to reverse these declines. Based on their research, the study's authors state:  \"We propose that the Emperor penguin is fully deserving of endangered status due to climate change, and can act as an iconic example of a new global conservation paradigm for species threatened by future climate change.\" The team's study acknowledges the special problems of defining conservation criteria for species endangered by future climate change, because the negative effects of climate change may build up over time. \"Listing the Emperor penguin as an endangered species would reflect the scientific assessment of the threats facing an important part of the Antarctic ecosystem under climate change,\" said Caswell. \"When a species is at risk due to one factor -- in this case, climate change -- it can be helped, sometimes greatly, by amelioration of other factors. That's why the Endangered Species Act is written to protect an endangered species in a number of ways -- exploitation, habitat, disturbance, etc. -- even if those factors are not the cause of its current predicament.\" \"Listing the emperor penguin will provide some tools to improve fishing practices of US vessels in the Southern Ocean, and gives a potential tool to help reduce CO2 emissions in the US under the Clear Air and Clean Water Acts,\" Jenouvrier said. The authors offer recommendations and considerations for new international conservation paradigms, including the identification of potential refuges for preserving populations.

{"text": "The biggest threat to emperor penguins may not be leopard seals or even killer whales, but a much larger predator:  global warming. Climate change, which is quickly melting the sea ice this species depends on for survival, could cause dramatic drops in the number of emperor penguins across Antarctica by the end of the century, a new study finds. Specifically, more than two-thirds of Antarctica's emperor penguin colonies will decline by more than 50 percent by the end of the century under future climate change scenarios. The researchers, from France, the Netherlands and the United States, are pushing to have this iconic species listed as endangered before its numbers hit critical lows. Doing so, the researchers said, may establish \"a new global conservation paradigm for species threatened by future climate change.\" [See Photos of Antarctica's Amazing Penguin Chicks] The research, detailed yesterday (June 29) in the journal Climate Change, is based in part on a 50-year intensive study  supported by the French Polar Institute (IPEV) and Zone Atelier Antarctique (LTER France)  of an emperor penguin colony in Terre Adlie, East Antarctica. Researchers have been closely monitoring the Terre Adlie population each year, collecting biological measurements of the penguins there and charting the population's growth and decline. \"Long-term studies like this are invaluable for measuring the response of survival and breeding to changes in sea ice,\" said Hal Caswell, a scientist with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) in Massachusetts and the University of Amsterdam. \"They provide our understanding of the role sea ice plays in the emperor penguin's life cycle.\" Emperor penguins breed and raise their offspring almost exclusively on sea ice. And changes in sea ice concentration (SIC), or the relative area of water covered by sea ice, affect not only penguins, but also the entire Antarctic food web, down to the smallest of species, the researchers noted. \"The role of sea ice is complicated,\" said Stephanie Jenouvrier, a biologist with the WHOI, in a statement. \"Too much ice requires longer trips for penguin parents to travel to the ocean to hunt and bring back food for their chicks. But too little ice reduces the habitat for krill, a critical food source for emperor penguins. Our models take into account both the effects of too much and too little sea ice in the colony area.\" Both Jenouvrier and Caswell have previously studied how changes in the concentration of sea ice might affect emperor penguin populations over the next several decades. In 2012, the two scientists and their team published a study in the journal Global Change Biology, which found that the Terre Adlie penguin population could decline by 80 percent by the end of this century. [Happy Feet:  A Gallery of Pudgy Penguins] For their newest study, the researchers expanded on this previous work, using the established population models from Terre Adlie to project how all 45 of Antarctica's known emperor penguin colonies would respond to future climate change. The projections included in the study are based on the current sea ice concentration and anticipated ones at each location. The models take into account physical processes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and land surfaces. \"If sea ice declines at the rates projected by the IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] climate models, and continues to influence emperor penguins as it did in the second half of the twentieth century in Terre Adlie, at least two-thirds of the colonies are projected to have declined by greater than 50 percent from their current size by 2100,\" Jenouvrier said. \"None of the colonies, even the southern-most locations in the Ross Sea, will provide a viable refuge by the end of 21st century.\" The colonies located between the Eastern Weddell Sea and Western Indian Ocean showed the largest declines, while those penguin colonies in the Ross Sea would experience the smallest decline. Some 20 percent of emperor penguin colonies will be nearly extinct by 2100, the analysis showed. Based on their research, the study's authors found that the emperor penguin, which is currently under consideration for inclusion on the U.S. Endangered Species Act, is fully deserving of endangered status due to climate change. Securing the species a spot on the endangered species list, the researchers believe, could both protect this iconic animal and set a precedent for how to protect other species that are also affected by climate change. \"When a species is at risk due to one factor  in this case, climate change  it can be helped, sometimes greatly, by amelioration of other factors,\" Caswell said in the statement. \"That's why the Endangered Species Act is written to protect an endangered species in a number of ways  exploitation, habitat, disturbance, etc.  even if those factors are not the cause of its current predicament.\" For instance, listing the emperor penguin as endangered could lead to improved fishing practices of U.S. vessels in the Southern Ocean, as well as provide an impetus for reduction in emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide across the globe, Jenouvrier explained.

The world's largest penguin species came to global fame with a 2005 documentary, March of the Penguins, portraying their annual trek across the icy wastes, and the 2006 cartoon movie Happy Feet. The new study sheds light on the birds' reliance on sea ice for breeding and raising their young. The ice also protects their prey - fish and krill - by maintaining the food chain. Declining sea ice caused by climate change would place all 45 known emperor penguin colonies into decline by 2100, according to the population simulation. \"At least two-thirds (of colonies) are projected to have declined by (more than) 50 per cent from their current size\" by the end of the century, said the paper published in the journal Nature Climate Change.

{"text": "Climate change is likely to cut Antarctica's 600,000-strong emperor penguin population by at least a fifth by 2100, a study suggests. The main threat to the penguins comes from changes to sea-ice cover in the Antarctic, which will affect their breeding and feeding. Dynamics will differ between penguin colonies, but all are expected to be in decline by the end of the century. Details are published in Nature Climate Change journal. The US, British and Dutch researchers urge governments to list the birds as endangered. Such a listing could impose restrictions on tourism and fishing. The team, led by Stephanie Jenouvrier of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, said the global population of emperor penguins would probably decline by between 19 and 33% from current levels. Dr Jenouvrier said the penguins \"face possible extinction throughout a significant portion of their range in the foreseeable future\". She added that emperor colonies in Antarctica's Ross Sea may experience population declines later than others because sea ice conditions are still suitable for them. \"Implementing a marine protected area in the Ross Sea could help buy time to avoid extinction and to put in place needed conservation and greenhouse gas mitigation strategies,\" she said. To feed their young, emperor penguins leave the colony for months at a time and travel long distances across Antarctic ice to reach open water to find nourishment, such as krill. They are dependent upon an optimal amount of sea ice cover for a variety of reasons, including refuge from predators while foraging. Changes to the sea-ice cover can also significantly affect the abundance of krill, the emperor's primary food source and a critical species in the Antarctic food web. More sea-ice is good for krill, but means that parents might have to waddle further to the sea. \"There is a goldilocks point for ice and emperor penguins,\" Phil Trathan, an expert at the British Antarctic Survey (Bas), told Reuters. Mr Trathan said it was unclear if the ungainly birds could adapt by climbing on to land or higher ice. Four emperor penguin colonies had recently been found on ice shelves, above sea level where glaciers spill off the land. Satellite measurements of Antarctic sea-ice extent show winter coverage to be at record levels.

This research was the first to look at the long-term effects of climate change for emperor penguins - the largest species of penguins, which can grow as tall as 1.2 meters. The study also shed light on how climate change affected the local fauna of one of the planet's remotest ecosystem. Overall, the researchers reported that the population projection would decrease by 19 percent by 2100, as more sea ice continues melting. \"It's not happy news for the emperor penguin,\" Hal Castellan of the U.S. Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, a co-author of the study, told Reuters. Emperor penguins were observed huddling together to keep both each other and their eggs warm. Aside from presenting population projections, the study also called upon different governments to include the bird in their endangered species list. This comes despite projections stating that populations will rise by 2050, before dipping into a decline 50 years later. Adding the emperor penguin on the list of endangered species might help restore its population by protecting them from fishing companies and tourism. The researchers noted 18 types of penguins whose populations were in danger of extinction. Emperor penguins were included in the list of stable species while the population of adelie, king, and chinstrap penguins were noted to increase.

{"text": "Loss of Antarctic sea ice through climate change threatens the emperor penguins habitat to such an extent that scientists say it should now be made an iconic symbol  like Chinas endangered giant panda  of the wildlife conservation movement. LONDON, 3 July, 2014  Global warming will this century take its toll of Antarcticas most regal predator, the emperor penguin. There are now 45 colonies of this wonderful bird, but by 2100 the populations of two-thirds of these colonies will have fallen by half or more. Stphanie Jenouvrier, a biologist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in the US, and colleagues from France and the Netherlands report in Nature Climate Change that changes in the extent and thickness of sea ice will create serious problems for a flightless, streamlined ,survival machine that can live and even breed at minus 40C, trek across 120 kilometres of ice, and dive to depths of more than 500 metres. The researchers took all the data from 50 years of intensive observation of one colony in Terre Adlie and used climate models to project a future for the other 44 colonies known in the Antarctic. They found that the decisive factor in emperor penguin survival was the sea ice. If the seas warmed and there wasnt enough ice, then that affected the levels of krill in the southern ocean, and therefore reduced the available prey. It also made the penguins more vulnerable to other predators. If the opposite happened and there was too much sea ice, then foraging trips took longer and penguin chicks were less likely to survive. Aptenodytes forsteri  the Linnean name for the emperor  is not in trouble yet, and its numbers may even grow in the years up to 2050. But this growth wont last, and decline is likely everywhere. Climate change has already begun to affect penguin species much further north, in Argentina, by taking toll of young chicks. For different reasons, the average rise in global temperatures forecast by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) could push the emperor into the endangered class. If sea ice declines at the rates projected by the IPCC climate models, and continues to influence emperor penguins as it did in the second half of the 20th century in Terre Adlie, at least two-thirds of the colonies are projected to have declined by greater than 50% from their current size by 2100, Dr Jenouvrier said. None of the colonies, even the southernmost locations in the Ross Sea, will provide a viable refuge by the end of the 21st century. The researchers end their paper by arguing that the emperor should  like the giant panda in China  become an icon for the conservation movement.

{"text": "Penguins depend on sea ice for survival, the same ice that is rapidly changing as global temperatures tick upwards. By the end of this century, the emperor penguin population is projected to dramatically decline if trends continue. Antarcticas emperor penguin population is currently estimated at 600,000. If researchers are correct nearly 1/5th of them may be gone by 2100. The international science community is pushing for emperor penguins to be listed as an endangered species. Protection under the endangered species act would force the creation of marine reserves in Antarctica and force laws that would protect animals. Researchers say that emperor penguins are fully deserved of endangered status do to irrefutable climate changes impacting their food supply and reproduction ability. The threat to the penguin population in Antarctica was announced as a result of a 50 year study by the French Polar Institute. Penguins rely on sea ice for breeding and raising offspring. Changes in sea ice threaten the existence of multiple species in the region. The concentration of the sea ice is whats important. Too thick and penguins struggle to hunt. Too thin and major penguin food sources are diminished. Emperor penguins feast on krill, which is a shrimp-like animal that thrives in the sea ice of Antarctica. Climate change impacts penguins despite the species remarkable ability to adapt breeding grounds. Overcoming lack of food though is something no species will survive. Hal Caswell, one of the authors of the study had a grim projection, The (penguin) population is declining. Unless something changes to stop that, the population will go into extinction. Penguins breed on the sea ice where males huddle together around eggs, keeping them warm in minus 50 degree temperatures. As the ice melts, scientists are unclear in penguins will continue to adapt and relocate to higher ice shelves. Despite rising global temperatures, sea ice in Antartica is actually expanding in the current climate. Researchers determined that the decline in penguin population might not be visible until 2050. The iconic animals that grow to four feet long havent received as much attention as polar bears, but according to researchers, we should be just as worried.

An American major general was reported to have been killed in the shooting today. The general's name was not released, but Coalition officials said an Afghan commander was also shot along with other Coalition and Afghan troops. About \"a dozen\" of the wounded are said to be Americans. A report also indicated that five British troops were among the injured. The casualty count may rise, as a number of injuries were said to be serious because the attacker fired at close range. A Reuters report cited an American official as saying the attacker had used a light machinegun. A number of victims were evacuated by Coalition helicopters following the attack. The attack took place at the Marshal Fahim National Defense University in Kabul City, the International Security Assistance Force noted in a press release. \"This facility was incorrectly named Camp Qargha in a previous release,\" ISAF stated, while confirming one of its personnel was killed in the attack. The Bundeswehr stated that the incident occurred just before 10 a.m. during a \"key leader engagement\" meeting at the training facility for Afghan troops, and that a German general had been injured but was \"out of danger,\" Die Welt reported. The Afghan Defense Ministry said the attack took place around 12 noon, and a local official told Pajhwok Afghan News that the clash, which was triggered by an argument, resulted in the killing of three Afghan troops as well as at least four Coalition troops. According to Ministry of Defence spokesman General Zahir Azimi, a terrorist in ANA uniform opened fire on Afghan and foreign forces and was killed by Afghan soldiers in return fire. Afghan sources told the BBC that the attacker had been recruited to the Afghan army three years ago. Camp Qargha was the site of a previous green-on-blue, or insider attack, in late October 2013, in which two NATO troops were wounded and an Afghan soldier was killed. The incident occurred when a New Zealand trainer and his Australian guards were fired upon at a checkpoint as they left an Afghan base on their way back to a new British-Afghan military training facility in Qargha. The Coalition troops had tried to take a confiscated laptop from the attacker. The Taliban denied responsibility for the attack. The Taliban have not claimed credit for today's attack, but did mention the incident in a statement on their website, Voice of Jihad. \"An Afghan soldiers [sic] turn his gun on the foreign trainers in police academy in Qargha area of Kabul city, killing four invaders and wounding some others,\" the Taliban statement says. \"A high-ranking officer was among four foreign military trainers killing in the shooting.\" Today's attack is the third reported green-on-blue attack in Afghanistan so far this year, and the sixth to have taken place in Kabul since January 2007, according to The Long War Journal's statistics. The number of reported attacks on Coalition personnel in Afghanistan has dropped steeply since a high of 44 in 2012. Last year there were 13 such attacks. [For in-depth information, see LWJ special report, Green-on-blue attacks in Afghanistan:  the data.] The decline in attacks is due to several factors, including the continuing drawdown of Coalition personnel, reduced partnering with Afghan forces, and the adoption of heightened security measures in interactions between Coalition and Afghan forces. The Taliban have devoted significant efforts to stepping up attempts to kill NATO troops and foreigners by infiltrating the ranks of Afghan security forces. Mullah Omar said as much in a statement released on Aug. 16, 2012, when he claimed that the Taliban \"cleverly infiltrated in the ranks of the enemy according to the plan given to them last year [2011],\" and he urged government officials and security personnel to defect and join the Taliban as a matter of religious duty.

{"text": "A man in an Afghan Army uniform opened fire Tuesday at a military base, killing a U.S. general and wounding 15 people, among them a German brigadier general and a number of Americans troops. U.S. officials identified the murdered American late Tuesday as Maj. Gen. Harold Greene. Greene was the highest-ranked American officer killed in combat since 1970 in the Vietnam War. Greene, who was on his first deployment to a war zone, was involved in preparing Afghan forces for the time when U.S.-coalition troops leave at the end of this year. An engineer by training, he was the deputy commanding general, Combined Security Transition Command-Afghanistan. Pentagon spokesman, Rear Adm. John Kirby, said earlier that the assailant fired into a group of international soldiers at the Marshal Fahim National Defense University at Camp Qargha, a base west of Kabul, and was subsequently killed. Another 15 people, roughly half of them Americans, were wounded. Among the wounded were a German brigadier general, two Afghan generals and an Afghan officer, whose rank the Afghan Defense Ministry did not provide. The attack occurred during a site visit to the university by coalition members. Ministry spokesman Gen. Mohammad Zahir Azimi said a \"terrorist in an army uniform\" opened fire on both local and international troops. The Qargha shooting comes as so-called \"insider attacks\" --  incidents in which Afghan security turn on their NATO partners -- largely dropped last year. In 2013, there were 16 deaths in 10 separate attacks. In 2012, such attacks killed 53 coalition troops in 38 separate attacks. Germany's military said 15 NATO soldiers were wounded in an assault launched \"probably by internal attackers.\" The wounded included a German brigadier general, who the German military said was receiving medical treatment and was \"not in a life-threatening condition.\" NATO said it was investigating the attack, which Afghan President Hamid Karzai condemned as \"cowardly.\" It is \"an act by the enemies who don't want to see Afghanistan have strong institutions,\" Karzai said in a statement. Officials with the Taliban could not be immediately reached for comment. Qargha is known as \"Sandhurst in the sand\"-- referring to the famed British military academy -- as British forces oversaw building the officer school and its training program. In a statement, the British Defense Ministry said it was investigating the incident and that \"it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.\" Soldiers were tense in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. One soldier in a NATO convoy leaving Camp Qargha fired a pistol in an apparent warning shot in the vicinity of Associated Press journalists who were in a car, as well as pedestrians standing nearby. AP photographer Massoud Hossaini said he and an AP colleague were about 15 feet from the soldier at the time. \"The vehicle before the last one, someone shouted at me,\" Hossaini said. \"The last one, the soldier opened fire.\" No one was wounded. Such \"insider attacks\" are sometimes claimed by the Taliban insurgency as proof of their infiltration. Others are attributed to personal disputes or resentment by Afghans who have soured on the continued international presence in their country more than a dozen years after the fall of the Taliban's ultra-conservative Islamic regime. Foreign aid workers, contractors, journalists and other civilians in Afghanistan are increasingly becoming targets of violence as the U.S.-led military coalition continues a withdrawal to be complete by the end of the year. In eastern Paktia province, an Afghan police guard also exchanged fire Tuesday with NATO troops near the governor's office, provincial police chief Gen. Zelmia Oryakhail said. The guard was killed in the gunfight, he said. It wasn't clear if the two incidents were linked and police said they were investigating the incident. Meanwhile Tuesday, a NATO helicopter strike targeting missile-launching Taliban militants killed four civilians in western Afghanistan, an Afghan official said Tuesday. NATO said they were investigating the attack. The attack in western Herat province comes as civilian casualties from NATO attacks remain a contentious issue across the country. Almost 200 people protested against NATO in Herat on Tuesday, carrying the bodies of the dead civilians into the provincial capital and demanding an investigation. In a statement, NATO said it was aware of the attack and was investigating, without elaborating. Civilians increasingly find themselves under fire as the 2001 U.S.-led war draws to a close, as Afghan forces take the lead in operations targeting the Taliban. The civilian death toll in the war in Afghanistan rose 17 percent for the first half of this year, the United Nations reported in July. The U.N. said 1,564 civilians were killed from January through June, compared with 1,342 in the first six months of 2013. Insurgents were responsible for 74 percent of the casualties, the U.N. said, while pro-government forces were responsible for 9 percent, government forces 8 percent and foreign troops 1 percent. The rest could not be attributed to any group. Karzai has repeatedly clashed with NATO over civilian casualties and strongly condemned the helicopter attack Tuesday.

{"text": "KABUL, Afghanistan (AP)  A man dressed in an Afghan army uniform opened fire Tuesday on foreign troops at a military base, killing at least one NATO soldier and wounding 15, including a German brigadier general and \"about a dozen\" Americans, authorities said. Details about the attack at Camp Qargha, a base west of the capital, Kabul, weren't immediately clear. Gen. Mohammmad Zahir Azimi, a spokesman for Afghanistan's Defense Ministry, said a \"terrorist in an army uniform\" opened fire on both local and international troops. Azimi said the shooter had been killed. Germany's military said one NATO soldier was killed, while 15 NATO soldiers were wounded. The wounded included a German brigadier general, who the German military said was receiving medical treatment and was \"not in a life-threatening condition.\" A U.S. official said \"about a dozen\" of the wounded were Americans, but declined to comment further. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss details of the attack by name on the record. In its statement, NATO said that it was \"in the process of assessing the situation.\" Qargha is known as \"Sandhurst in the sand,\" as British forces oversaw building the officer school and its training program. In a statement, the British Defense Ministry said it was investigating the incident and that \"it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.\" The attack comes as so-called \"insider attacks\"  incidents in which Afghan security turn on their NATO partners  largely dropped last year. In 2013, there were 16 deaths in 10 separate attacks. In 2012, such attacks killed 53 coalition troops in 38 separate attacks. Such \"insider attacks\" are sometimes claimed by the Taliban insurgency as proof of their infiltration. Others are attributed to personal disputes or resentment by Afghans who have soured on the continued international presence in their country more than a dozen years after the fall of the Taliban's ultra-conservative Islamic regime. Foreign aid workers, contractors and other civilians in Afghanistan are increasingly becoming targets of violence as the U.S.-led military coalition continues a withdrawal to be complete by the end of the year. In eastern Paktia province, an Afghan police guard also exchanged fire Tuesday with NATO troops near the governor's office, provincial police chief Gen. Zelmia Oryakhail said. The guard was killed in the gunfight, he said. It wasn't clear if the two incidents were linked and police said they were investigating the incident. Meanwhile Tuesday, a NATO helicopter strike targeting missile-launching Taliban militants killed four civilians in western Afghanistan, an Afghan official said Tuesday. NATO said they were investigating the attack. The attack in western Herat province comes as civilian casualties from NATO attacks remain a contentious issue across the country. Almost 200 people protested against NATO in Herat on Tuesday, carrying the bodies of the dead civilians into the provincial capital and demanding an investigation. The strike happened Monday night in the province's Shindan district, said Raouf Ahmadi, a spokesman for the provincial chief of police. He said Taliban militants launched a missile at an airport nearby, drawing the NATO helicopter's fire. He said the NATO attack killed two men, one woman and a child. In a statement, NATO said it was aware of the attack and was investigating, without elaborating. NATO \"takes all allegations of civilian casualties seriously, and is assessing the facts surrounding this incident,\" it said. Civilians increasingly find themselves under fire as the 2001 U.S.-led war draws to a close, as Afghan forces take the lead in operations targeting the Taliban. The civilian death toll in the war in Afghanistan rose 17 percent for the first half of this year, the United Nations reported in July. The U.N. said 1,564 civilians were killed from January through June, compared with 1,342 in the first six months of 2013. It blamed Insurgents were responsible for 74 percent of the casualties, the U.N. said, while pro-government forces were responsible for 9 percent, government forces 8 percent and foreign troops just 1 percent.

{"text": "KABUL, Afghanistan - An American general was killed in an apparent insider attack Tuesday by a member of the Afghan security forces, a Pentagon spokesman said, the highest-ranking U.S. Army officer to be killed in the Iraq or Afghanistan wars. The spokesman, Rear Adm. John Kirby, said that the assailant, dressed in an Afghan army uniform, fired into a group of international soldiers at the Marshal Fahim National Defense University at Camp Qargha, a base west of Kabul, and was subsequently killed. The American general was identified late Tuesday as Major Gen. Harold Greene. Gen. Greene was deputy chief of the training and assistance command which is at the heart of the American strategy to pull its combat troops out of Afghanistan by the end of this year. As a two-star general, he was the highest ranking American officer killed since 9/11, when one of the hijacked airliners smashed into the pentagon, killing, among others, a three-star General Timothy Maude. Another 15 people, roughly half of them Americans, were wounded. CBS News correspondent David Martin reported that some were in serious condition. Among the wounded were a German brigadier general, two Afghan generals and an Afghan officer, whose rank the Afghan Defense Ministry did not provide. The attack occurred during a site visit to the university by coalition members. While details remained murky about what sparked the attack, it showed the challenges still remaining in Afghanistan, a nation that's known three decades of war without end. Gen. Mohammad Zahir Azimi, a spokesman for Afghanistan's Defense Ministry, said a \"terrorist in an army uniform\" opened fire on both local and international troops. Azimi said the shooter had been killed and that three Afghan army officers were wounded. He did not offer a motive for the assault. Martin said it wasn't immediately clear whether the attacker was in fact a member of the Afghan military, or just wearing a stolen or fake uniform, though Kirby said he had no reason to doubt that the assailant was a member of the Afghan military. NATO said it was investigating the attack, which Afghan President Hamid Karzai condemned as \"cowardly.\" It is \"an act by the enemies who don't want to see Afghanistan have strong institutions,\" Karzai said in a statement. In a statement sent to journalists, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid praised the \"Afghan soldier\" who carried out the attack, as well as a police officer in Paktia province who shot at NATO forces earlier Tuesday. He did not claim the attacks. CBS News' Ahmad Mukhtar reported that Camp Qargha is funded by Britain and is modeled on the esteemed Sandhurst British military academy. Camp Qargha is expected to be Britain's only military presence in the country after combat troops complete their pullout by next year. In a statement, the British Defense Ministry said it was investigating the incident and that \"it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.\" Soldiers were tense in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. One soldier in a NATO convoy leaving Camp Qargha fired a pistol in an apparent warning shot in the vicinity of Associated Press journalists who were in a car, as well as pedestrians standing nearby. AP photographer Massoud Hossaini said he and an AP colleague were about 15 feet from the soldier at the time. \"The vehicle before the last one, someone shouted at me,\" Hossaini said. \"The last one, the soldier opened fire.\" No one was wounded. The Qargha shooting comes as so-called \"insider attacks\" - incidents in which Afghan security turn on their NATO partners - largely dropped last year.

{"text": "A gunman wearing an Afghan army uniform opened fire at an officers school near Kabul Tuesday, killing a two-star US major general  the highest-ranking officer to be killed in the 13-year-old war in Afghanistan. Brandishing a light machine gun, the terrorist also wounded up to a dozen other Americans, three Afghan army officers and a German brigadier general who suffered a non-life threatening injury, authorities said Tuesday. The US general  the first to die in the line of duty since 9/11 and first in overseas combat since Vietnam  was identified as Maj. Gen. Harold Greene, the Associated Press reported. Its so sad that this happened, Harold Greene, 85, the generals dad, said at his upstate home. As a father, you never want your children to die before you do. And now I have to bury my son. The father said that the generals mother died a year ago and they were still grieving that loss. Its just too much tragedy thats hit this family, he said. My wife, Eva, died about a year ago. As a family, we are just trying to stay strong. An Afghanistan Defense Ministry spokesman said the terrorist in an army uniform was killed after firing on the troops at Camp Qargha at about noon local time. The BBC reported that the attacker was a soldier who was recruited three years ago, citing Afghan defense sources. A US official said about a dozen of the wounded were Americans, but declined to comment further. Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said officials believed the gunman was a member of the Afghan national security forces, and called the insider attacks a pernicious threat but had few other details. Its a terrible day. A terrible tragedy, he said. Its impossible to eliminate that threat [of insider attacks] but you can work hard to mitigate it. Afghanistan is still a war zone. In a statement, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid praised the Afghan hero soldier who turned his weapon against foreign invaders, stopping short of taking responsibility for the attack. Its impossible to eliminate that threat [of insider attacks] but you can work hard to mitigate it. Afghanistan is still a war zone. The Taliban, meanwhile, praised the shootings  but stopped short of taking responsibility for the bloodshed. It is rare for such a high-ranking officer to be killed in combat. The last US general was the first officer of that rank killed in the line of duty since Lt. Gen. Timothy L. Maude was killed during the 9/11 terrorist attack on the Pentagon. NATO said it was investigating the attack, which Afghan President Hamid Karzai condemned as cowardly. It is an act by the enemies who dont want to see Afghanistan have strong institutions, Karzai said in a statement. Qargha is known as Sandhurst in the sand referring to the famed British military academy  as British forces oversaw building the officer school and its training program. In a statement, the British Defense Ministry said it was investigating the incident and that it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time. After the shooting, a soldier in a NATO convoy leaving Camp Qargha fired his pistol in an apparent warning shot in the vicinity of Associated Press journalists and pedestrians nearby. No one was wounded. The Qargha shooting comes as so-called insider attacks  incidents in which Afghan security turn on their NATO partners  largely dropped last year. In 2013, there were 16 deaths in 10 separate attacks. In 2012, such attacks killed 53 coalition troops in 38 separate attacks. Such insider attacks are sometimes claimed by the Taliban insurgency as proof of their infiltration. Others are attributed to personal disputes or resentment by Afghans who have soured on the continued international presence in their country more than a dozen years after the fall of the Talibans ultra-conservative Islamic regime. Greene, a Schenectady native commissioned as an officer after graduating Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1980, was an Army engineer who had been posted to Afghanistan for the first time earlier this year to prepare Afghan forces for the withdrawal of US and coalition troops. Greenes current stateside home is in Falls Church, Va., where he lived with his wife, Army Col. Sue Myers, and their daughter, Amelia Greene. Their son, West Point grad Matthew Joseph Myers Greene, changed his Facebook profile Tuesday afternoon to a photo of himself with his father, as friends offered condolences. Maj. Gen.

Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Admiral John Kirby said at a news conference hours after the incident that the officer, Maj. Gen. Harold Greene, was one of if not the highest ranking deaths in the war in Afghanistan. Greene was re-assigned in January from a position in Washington, D.C., to take on the role of deputy commanding general in Afghanistan. Multiple news outlets reported through the day that a U.S. Army major general was killed in the attack in Kabul, with the New York Times saying the officer was the highest-ranking member of the U.S. military to die in hostilities in Afghanistan. Kirby said there were up to 15 casualties, including members of the Afghan National Security Forces. He said the shooter was suspected to be a member of the ANSF. The NATO-led forces confirmed earlier that the attack occurred at the Marshal Fahim National Defense University in Kabul, and not Camp Qargha as the German military said in its statement earlier Tuesday. A spokesman for Afghanistans Defense Ministry, Gen. Mohammad Zahir Azimi, said a terrorist in an army uniform opened fire on local and international troops, according to the Associated Press.Azimi said the shooter was killed. The German military, which said the assault was launched probably by internal attackers, said a German brigadier general was among the injured. So-called insider attacks in Afghanistan have dropped sharply since 2012, when such attacks killed 53 coalition troops, according to the AP. Last year, 16 people were killed by such attacks. The Taliban, which often take credit for such attacks, did not immediately comment to a New York Times reporter.", "label": {"what": ["A man in an Afghan army uniform opened fire Tuesday on American-led coalition forces in Afghanistan", "the attack occurred at the Marshal Fahim National Defense University in Kabul", "a terrorist in an army uniform opened fire on local and international troops"], "when": ["Tuesday", "in January", "earlier Tuesday", "since 2012"], "where": ["in Afghanistan", "in Washington, D.C", "in Kabul", "at the Marshal Fahim National Defense University in Kabul", "Camp Qargha"], "why": ["take on the role of deputy commanding general"], "who": ["Maj.

{"text": "A man believed to be an Afghan soldier opened fire at an Afghan military academy in Kabul on Tuesday, killing a U.S. general and wounding up to 15 other personnel, including a German general and eight Americans, U.S. and coalition officials said. Army Maj. Gen. Harold J. Greene, deputy commanding general of Combined Security Transition Command-Afghanistan in Kabul, is the highest-ranking U.S. service member killed in Iraq or Afghanistan. U.S. officials said five of the eight wounded Americans are in serious condition; a number of British soldiers and three Afghan troops were also wounded. Greene previously served as the Armys deputy for acquisition and systems management, a role in which he oversaw acquisition reform initiatives. He was commissioned as an engineer officer in 1980 after graduating from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y. The attack occurred about 12:  23 p.m., according to an official at the German Embassy in Washington, who confirmed the wounding of a German brigadier general in the attack. The assailant was killed, said Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary. He would not say whether the shooter was killed by coalition troops or Afghans. Its a terrible day. Its a terrible tragedy, said Kirby, adding that coalition officials have no reason to believe that the shooter was not a member of the Afghan National Security Forces. The attack occurred at the Marshal Fahim National Defense University, said the U.S.-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). The facility, in the Qarga district of Kabul province and west of the city, was known as the Afghan National Defense University until this year. It was renamed after the Afghan vice president and former military commander who died in March of an undisclosed illness. A spokesman for the Afghan Defense Ministry, Gen. Mohammad Zahir Azimi, and other Afghan officials described the attacker as a terrorist dressed in an Afghan army uniform who opened fire on a delegation of military visitors. A Taliban spokesman issued a statement early Wednesday on the military academy attack, praising the shooters actions but not claiming responsibility. The spokesman e-mailed a statement to journalists in Afghan Pashto saying that a sensible Afghan had killed an Italian general and three American soldiers. The facts were not correct because the only American killed was Greene. No Italian officer was harmed but a German general was shot and seriously wounded. Sources at the Defense Ministry said the attacker had been a member of the Afghan National Army for the past two years and was from southeastern Afghanistan. They did not identify him. They said he used a light assault rifle to fire on the foreign military delegation before he was fatally shot by Afghan personnel. President Obama received a briefing on the attack from the ISAF commander, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said. Earnest reiterated that the administration believes that while Afghanistan remains a dangerous place, its security needs must be met by the Afghan government. While we have made tremendous progress in disrupting, dismantling and defeating al-Qaeda operations and leadership in Afghanistan and progress in winding down U.S. involvement in that conflict, this shooting is, of course, a painful reminder of the service and sacrifice that our men and women in uniform make every day for this country, Earnest said. The shooting occurred as plans for the future presence of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, after the final withdrawal of combat forces in December, remained in limbo. Delays continued in the slow process of auditing votes from the June runoff between presidential candidates Ashraf Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah, who have accused each others campaigns of fraud. Although Obama has said that 9,800 U.S. troops will remain for training and counterterrorism missions, their presence would require the new Afghan president to sign a bilateral security agreement with the United States. Inauguration of a successor to President Hamid Karzai, originally scheduled for last Saturday, has been indefinitely postponed. Both candidates agreed in July, in a deal brokered by Secretary of State John F. Kerry, to form a unity government after a complete recount of all 8 million votes cast. So far, only about 10 percent of the votes have been counted amid continuing controversy over which ballots should be invalidated, and the candidates themselves reportedly have made little progress in discussions on the terms of a power-sharing arrangement. Karzai said in a statement that the victims of Tuesdays attack were visiting the academy as part of an effort to help us build up the Afghan security forces. He blamed the assault on enemies who dont want to see Afghanistan have strong institutions. The senior United Nations official in Afghanistan issued a statement of condolence Tuesday night to the families and colleagues of international and Afghan troops killed and wounded in the attack. The statement from Jan Kubis, the U.N. special representative for Afghanistan, said international forces continue to perform a critical role in Afghanistans security and are providing critical training for the countrys future and stability. He called the attack a tragedy. The academy is a centerpiece of the coalitions plan to train the Afghan military. U.S. military officials have described it as the West Point of Afghanistan, a reference to the U.S. Armys military academy in New York state. The shooting Tuesday was one of a few major incidents of so-called insider attacks against Western forces in Afghanistan in recent months. Such attacks by Afghan trainees or soldiers against their Western instructors or colleagues grew in frequency over the past several years but tapered off as a result of stricter security and screening measures at military facilities. However, the number and scope of Taliban insurgent attacks has been increasing in recent months, with dozens of deadly incidents involving unusually large numbers of insurgents. Officials have said the Taliban is testing the strength of Afghan security forces as U.S. and NATO troops continue their withdrawal and prepare to place the nations defense largely in Afghan hands. Insider attacks have been a core concern of coalition troops in Afghanistan for years. As of June 24, there had been 87 there since 2008, killing 142 coalition troops and wounding an additional 165, according to a tally kept by the Long War Journal. The motives for the attacks have varied. In some cases, insurgents have infiltrated the Afghan military and police and waited for the opportunity to attack coalition troops. In others, Afghan troops have attacked the coalition troops training them after feeling personally offended, military officials have said. The worst year for insider attacks in Afghanistan was 2012, when 44 attacks killed 61 coalition troops, according to the Long War Journal. The rash of attacks that year prompted significant changes in the way Western and Afghan military service members interact. They included appointing guardian angel service members to stand guard while coalition troops and Afghans worked together. Insider attacks have been significantly down this year, with two recorded before Tuesday. Constable reported from Kabul.

{"text": "gunman believed to be an Afghan soldier opened fire Tuesday at a military academy in Kabul, killing a U.S. Army major general and wounding 14 others in one of the bloodiest fratricidal attacks of the 13-year war in Afghanistan. The shooter, who was wearing an Afghan army uniform, wounded a German brigadier general and three Afghan officers before he was killed, officials said. Eight of the casualties were U.S. troops, senior Pentagon officials said. Army Maj. Gen. Harold J. Greene, 55, the deputy commander responsible for training Afghan troops, was killed during what U.S. officials said was a routine site visit by coalition officers to Marshal Fahim National Defense University, an elite facility U.S. officials described as Afghanistans version of West Point. Greene, who had a doctorate in materials science from USC, was on his first combat tour in Afghanistan after a lengthy Army career as an engineer and logistics expert. He is believed to be the highest-ranking U.S. officer killed overseas since the Vietnam War. Its a terrible day. Its a terrible tragedy, Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, told reporters. The high-profile assault represents a grim renewal of the insider attacks by Afghans that killed dozens of Americans and other coalition troops two years ago. It is likely to prompt stricter security measures to protect the approximately 30,000 Americans, as well as other foreign troops, who remain in Afghanistan. Most of them are to be withdrawn by the end of the year. Kirby said the U.S. and its allies faced a pernicious threat from disaffected Afghan troops that was impossible to eliminate, despite strict vetting of Afghan soldiers and other security measures adopted since 2013. The shooting is also likely to focus new attention on the Obama administrations plan to keep 9,800 U.S. troops in Afghanistan after this year. Many would work closely with Afghan counterparts at training facilities in Kabul and on major military installations around the country. The plan has been on hold since last year because of Afghan President Hamid Karzais refusal to sign a bilateral security agreement laying out terms of the U.S. presence, including a U.S. demand that American troops be given immunity from prosecution under Afghan laws. U.S. officials are awaiting the outcome of the countrys disputed president election, hoping Karzais successor will sign the agreement. The Pentagon initially withheld Greenes name, citing a policy of waiting 24 hours after relatives are notified. But officials confirmed his identity after numerous news outlets published and broadcast his name. Germanys military confirmed that one of its brigadier generals was among those wounded. The injuries were not life-threatening. Kirby said the gunman was not a very high-ranking Afghan soldier. But officials released few details about the midday attack, including the attackers motive or how he was able to shoot a senior U.S. officer, who would typically be protected by security details with a mission to look out for just such a threat. The attacker was not immediately identified. Kirby said officials from Afghanistan and the International Security Assistance Force, the NATO-led force that is commanded by a U.S. general, had begun a joint investigation. Gen. Ray Odierno, the Army chief of staff, said in a statement that the Army was focused on helping Greenes family and the families of the wounded. Our priority right now is to take care of the families, ensuring they have all the resources they need during this critical time, he said. President Obama called Marine Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the top commander in Afghanistan, for a briefing on the shooting, according to Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. Todays tragic incident is a painful reminder that our servicemen and women are still serving and sacrificing in Afghanistan, Earnest said. And theyre facing significant risks to protect our country and to protect American citizens all around the globe. In a statement, Karzai condemned the attack as cowardly, calling it an act by the enemies who don't want to see Afghanistan have strong institutions. A spokesman for the Taliban insurgency, Zabiullah Mujahid, praised the honorable Afghan soldier who carried out the attack. But he did not assert that Taliban commanders had planned it, and he got some of the details wrong, saying the gunman killed one Italian and three U.S. generals, along with several others. The military academy is in the Qargha district, on the west side of Kabul, the capital. Afghan officer candidates receive instruction in academic subjects, as well as in tactics and other military skills before they receive commissions and are assigned to units in the field. A separate facility for training Afghanistans noncommissioned officers is nearby. It was unclear if the gunman was a student or teacher at the academy, was assigned to guard the visiting delegation of Afghan and foreign military officers, or was traveling with them. Greene, a native of upstate New York, joined the Army as an engineer in 1980 after graduating from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y. He earned masters degrees from Rensselaer and USC in addition to his PhD, according to an official Army biography. In January, he was assigned deputy commander of Combined Security Transition Command Afghanistan, the U.S.-led command that oversees the training of the Afghan military. He had previously completed tours in Germany, Turkey and Greece, though his official biography does not list previous tours in combat zones. He was living in Falls Church, Va., a suburb of Washington, with his wife, a retired Army colonel, when he was assigned to Afghanistan. Greene wanted to be in Afghanistan, according to a Defense official familiar with him. Greene told a colleague in March how happy he was to be over there working directly with soldiers and Afghan troops, the official said. His job helping the Afghan military improve training and logistics is not glamorous but is considered vital to the future of the still-fledgling Afghan military, the official said. He was a key figure in helping the Afghan forces develop their skills in logistics, the official said.

{"text": "Researchers affiliated with Yales Peabody Museum of Natural History have published the first detailed scientific account of a recently discovered monkey species living in a remote part of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). It is only the second new species of African monkey discovered since the mid-1980s. The slender, medium-sized primate  called a Lesula (luh-SOO-la) and roughly similar to a vervet monkey  represents a rare discovery of a previously undocumented mammal, and helps establish the sparsely settled central Congo as an important source of biodiversity, researchers said. They describe the animal in detail in the Sept. 12 issue of the journal PLOS ONE. This was a totally unexpected find, and we knew we had something unusual and possibly unknown when we first saw the animal. But it was not until we had the genetic and morphological analyses of our collaborating team that we knew we really had a new species, said John and Terese Hart, conservation biologists with the Lukuru Wildlife Research Foundation and curatorial affiliates of the Peabody. The Harts and members of their field teams were the first scientists to encounter a Lesula in 2007.  They saw a captive in a remote village, and subsequently observed it in the wild. The Lesula (Cercopithecus lomamiensis) seems to have escaped previous scientific notice because of its remote habitat, largely unexplored by professional biologists until recently. The Lesula is known to live exclusively within only 17,000 square kilometers of mature evergreen forests in DRCs eastern central basin, between the middle Lomami and upper Tshuapa rivers. Major discoveries like this are still possible, mainly thanks to dedicated field biologists like the Harts, said Eric Sargis, professor of anthropology at Yale and a co-author of the paper. And if were finding new species of primates, then who knows how many new species of small mammals or lizards or insects, just to name a few, might be out there. Theres certainly a lot of undiscovered biodiversity in this region. At least three other anthropoid primates are exclusive to the region, according to the researchers  the Lomami River red colobus, the Lomami River blue monkey, and the Kasuku River Wolfs monkey. Like all of Congos remaining large mammals, these species are threatened by uncontrolled commercial bush meat hunting and habitat loss. The challenge now is to make the Lesula an iconic species that carries the message for conservation for all of Congos endangered fauna, said John Hart. After their first coincidental encounter with the captive Lesula, the Harts and their research team observed it in the wild, documented its behavior and ecology, and ultimately determined its distinctiveness through genetic and anatomical studies. The latter were conducted at the Peabody by Sargis and co-author Chris Gilbert, a former Yale Institute for Biospheric Studies Gaylord Donnelley Environmental Postdoctoral Fellow and now a professor at Hunter College-CUNY. The typical Lesula has a naked face and muzzle and a mane of long, grizzled blond hairs. Some have a cream-colored vertical nose stripe. The monkey appears to eat fruits and vegetation primarily, and to live both on the ground and in trees. In their paper, researchers describe the Lesula and its sister species, Cercopithecus hamlyni, as shy, quiet and generally occur[ing] in small groups. Through the Harts, the Peabody has acquired several Lesula specimens that were essential for the genetic and anatomical studies, said Sargis, who also is curator of the Peabodys mammalogy collections. All specimens were collected after death, either at the hands of local hunters or, in one case, by crowned eagles. Other authors of the paper are Kate M.

{"text": "A shy, brightly colored monkey species has been found living in the lush rainforests at the heart of the Democratic Republic of Congo, a find that utterly surprised the researchers who came upon it. \"When I first saw it, I immediately knew it was something new and different  I just didn't know how significant it was,\" said John Hart, a veteran Congo researcher who is scientific director for the Lukuru Wildlife Research Foundation, based in Kinshasa. In fact, the find was something of a happy accident. Hart first spied the suspect monkey in 2007 while sifting through photographs brought back from a recently concluded field expedition to a remote region of central DRC. Yet the image that caught his eye hadn't been taken in the field. It was snapped in a village, and showed a young girl named Georgette with a tiny monkey that had taken a shine to the 13-year-old. [See Georgette and the monkey.] It was a gorgeous animal, Hart said, with a blond mane and upper chest, and a bright red patch on the lower back. \"I'd never seen that on any animal in the area, so right away I said, 'Hmmm,'\" he told OurAmazingPlanet. Hart decided to get to the bottom of the mystery. Fast forward through five years of field work, genetic research and anatomical study, and today (Sept. 12) Hart and a list of collaborators formally introduced to the world a new primate species, dubbed Cercopithecus lomamiensis, and known locally as the lesula. Their work is announced in the online journal PLOS One. It turned out that the little monkey that hung around Georgette's house had been brought to the area by the girl's uncle, who had found it on a hunting trip. It wasn't quite a pet, but it became known as Georgette's lesula. The young female primate passed its days running in the yard with the dogs, foraging around the village for food, and growing up into a monkey that belonged to a species nobody recognized. Further investigation revealed the full story of the strange monkey. It turned out that C. lomamiensis, a cryptic, skittish primate, roams a swath of dense rainforest some 6,500 square miles (17,000 square kilometers). \"For a big mammal to go unnoticed is pretty unusual,\" said Kate Detwiler, a primatologist and assistant professor at Florida Atlantic University, and an author on the paper. Yet one visit to the area that the lesula calls home reveals why the monkeys escaped scientific notice for so long, Detwiler told OurAmazingPlanet. This region of the DRC is remote and vast. The trees tower overhead, blocking out the sun, and the forest floor  the chief domain of the lesula  is steeped in a permanent gloom. The forest is full of sounds. At first light, the lesulas raise a lilting chorus of booming calls, distinct from the cries of their monkey neighbors who pass their lives in the trees high above the forest floor; at dusk, the cries of African grey parrots echo through the canopy. The earth is wet and soft, and feet sink into the ground with each step. There is a gentle, steady thud as fruit falls from the trees. One gets the feeling of being on a ship very far out to sea, Detwiler said ?only here, the ocean is the endless expanse of the trees. \"I felt so privileged to be there,\" she said. \"I wish everybody could have that experience.\" The lesulas live in this isolated region in groups up to five strong, and feeds on fruit and leafy plants. The males weigh up to 15 pounds (7 kilograms), about twice the size of the females. They also have some rather arresting anatomical features. \"They have giant blue backsides,\" Hart said. \"Bright aquamarine buttocks and testicles. What a signal! That aquamarine blue is really a bright color in forest understory.\" [World's Freakiest Looking Animals] \"So in terms of monkey viewing, females can definitely find males,\" Detwiler said. \"We don't really know what this means because it's very uncommon for monkeys in this lineage,\" she added. The only other monkey to share this feature is the lesula's closest cousin  the owl-faced monkey, a species that lives farther east. At first it was thought the monkeys were close kin, but genetic analysis suggests the two species split from a common ancestor about 2 million years ago. Now that the new species has been formally identified, Hart said, the next task is to save it. Although the lesula is new to science, it is a well-established sight on the dinner table. There's a thriving market for bush meat, particularly in urban areas, Hart said, and the monkeys are just one of dozens of species, from snakes to elephants to apes, that are targeted. \"People have disposable income, and this is the cheapest meat,\" he said. \"Bush meat is a go-to item because it's less expensive than chicken or beef. This is not a new problem, but it's a problem that doesn't have a solution yet.\" Hart and his wife, Terese, are partnering with local people to try to set up a national park in the lesulas' territory, but it's still a work in progress. In the meantime, researchers have set up camera traps in the dense forest to try to better understand the habits of the shy animals.

{"text": "Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Scientists are claiming they have discovered a new species of monkey living in the remote forests of the Democratic Republic of Congo -- an animal well-known to local hunters but until now, unknown to the outside world. In a paper published Wednesday in the open-access journal Plos One, the scientists describe the new species that they call Cercopithecus Lomamiensis, known locally as the Lesula, whose home is deep in central DR Congo's Lomami forest basin. The scientists say it is only the second discovery of a monkey species in 28 years. In an age where so much of the earth's surface has been photographed, digitized, and placed on a searchable map on the web discoveries like this one by a group of American scientists this seem a throwback to another time. \"We never expected to find a new species there,\" says John Hart, the lead scientist of the project, \"but the Lomami basin is a very large block that has had very little exploration by biologists.\" Hart says that the rigorous scientific process to determine the new species started with a piece of luck, strong field teams, and an unlikely field sighting in a small forest town. \"Our Congolese field teams were on a routine stop in Opala. It is the closest settlement of any kind to the area of forest we were working in,\" says Hart. The team came across a strange looking monkey tethered to a post. It was the pet of Georgette, the daughter of the local school director. She adopted the young monkey when its mother was killed by a hunter in the forest. Her father said it was a Lesula, well-known to hunters in that part of the forest. The field team took pictures and showed them to Hart. \"Right away I saw that this was something different. It looked a bit like a monkey from much further east, but the coloring was so different and the range was so different,\" said Hart. The monkey to the east is the semi-terrestrial owl-faced monkey. Based on the photos, Hart believed that their shape and size could be similar, but their morphology or outward appearance was very distinct. The Lesula had strikingly large, almost human like, eyes, a pink face and golden mane. Far to the east, across several large river systems, the Owl Face is aptly named. Its sunken eyes are set deep in a dark face, a white stripe running down from its brow to its mouth, like a line of chalk on a blackboard. To a layman it looks like an open and shut case. But animals are often widely divergent within a species -- humans are an obvious example -- so Hart and his team needed science to prove their gut feeling. \"I got in touch with geneticists and anthropologists to get their advice. I knew it was important to have a collaborative team of experts,\" says Hart. The exhaustive study took three years. Hart's teams set up digital sound recorders in the forests to record the morning calls of the Owl Face and Lesula monkeys. They analyzed the ecology of the forest and behavior of the shy and difficult to observe monkey. Field teams collected Lesula specimens from hunters and monkeys freshly killed by leopards and once, a crowned eagle (the field worker had to wait for the eagle to leave its perch, says Hart). The specimens were shipped to two research centers in the U.S and the data shared with labs across the country. Christopher Gilbert, an anthropologist based at Hunter College in Manhattan, says the difference in appearance between the Lesula and Owl Face was striking. \"After comparing the skins, we immediately concluded that this was probably something different [than] we had seen before,\" says Gilbert, an expert in primate and monkey evolution. Skulls of the Lesula and Owl Face monkey were measured with calipers and digitally drawn in 3D. \"We looked at the difference in shape and a number of landmarks in the skulls,\" says Gilbert. While the Owl Face and Lesula had similar sized skulls, he says, the Lesula had significantly larger orbits and several other small, but statistically significant, differences in the hard anatomy of the skull. The anatomical studies are backed up by genetics. Scientists at New York University and Florida Atlantic University were able trace an ancient common ancestor. Scientists believe the monkeys evolved separately after a series of rivers separated their habitats. \"The clincher was that lab and field teams were able to document significant difference in conjunction with the genetics. The monkeys were different and have been different for a couple of million years. It demonstrates that there are places in the world that we do not know much about,\" says Gilbert. The Lesula's range covers an area of about 6,500 square miles (17,000 square kilometers) between the Lomani and Tshuapa Rivers. Until recently, it was one of the Congo's least biologically explored forest blocks. Hart hopes that the announcement will bring a renewed effort to save central Africa's pristine forests. Under threat by loggers, bush meat hunters, and weak national governments, the forests are a potential well of important scientific discoveries, and a key linchpin of the earth's biodiversity. Teresa and John Hart's Lukuru Foundation is working with the Congolese authorities to establish a national park in the Lomani basin before it loses its unique biodiversity. \"The challenge now is to make the Lesula an iconic species that carries the message for conservation of all of DR Congo's endangered fauna,\" says Hart. And what of the first Lesula they found -- Georgette's pet. After he saw the pictures, Hart regularly sent a team to keep track of the young Lesula's progress. At some point Georgette let the monkey roam free. \"It seems someone captured it,\" says Hart, \"it probably ended up in the cooking pot.\" He hopes that with proper protection, the Lesula, and the rest of Lomani's incredible animal biodiversity, won't suffer a similar fate.", "label": {"what": ["Scientists are claiming they have discovered a new species of monkey living in the remote forests of the Democratic Republic of Congo", "The Lesula had strikingly large, almost human like, eyes, a pink face and golden mane", "Its sunken eyes are set deep in a dark face, a white stripe running down from its brow to its mouth, like a line of chalk on a blackboard", "Hart's teams set up digital sound recorders in the forests to record the morning calls of the Owl Face and Lesula monkeys", "Teresa and John Hart's Lukuru Foundation is working with the Congolese authorities to establish a national park in the Lomani basin before it loses its unique biodiversity"], "when": ["Wednesday"], "where": ["Nairobi, Kenya", "in the remote forests of the Democratic Republic of Congo", "in central DR Congo's Lomami forest basin", "in Opala", "in the U.S", "in Manhattan", "at New York University and Florida Atlantic University", "between the Lomani and Tshuapa Rivers"], "why": ["the Lomami basin is a very large block that has had very little exploration by biologists", "a piece of luck, strong field teams, and an unlikely field sighting in a small forest town", "animals are often widely divergent within a species", "Under threat by loggers, bush meat hunters, and weak national governments"], "who": ["Cercopithecus Lomamiensis, known locally as the Lesula", "John Hart, the lead scientist of the project", "Georgette, the daughter of the local school director", "Christopher Gilbert, an anthropologist based at Hunter College", "Gilbert, an expert in primate and monkey evolution"], "how": ["never expected to find a new species there", "got in touch with geneticists and anthropologists to get their advice", "Skulls of the Lesula and Owl Face monkey were measured with calipers and digitally drawn in 3D", "bring a renewed effort to save central Africa's pristine forests", "the forests are a potential well of important scientific discoveries, and a key linchpin of the earth's biodiversity"]}}

The species, known locally as the lesula, was discovered after a young female was seen kept captive at the home of a primary school director in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2007. The young animal resembled an owl faced monkey (Cercopithecus hamlyni) but the colour of its rear end was different to that of any known species, the researchers writing in the journal PLoS ONE said. In fact, they say, its blue rear end is unique. 'The blue perineum, buttocks and scrotum displayed by adult males are more extensive than genital patches in any other Cercopithecus', the researchers wrote. Other wild lesula (Cercopithecus lomamiensis) have since been found in their remote range in central Democratic Republic of Congo, where they live in forests and feed on leafstalks, fruit and flower buds.

Although the 6,500 square mile area in which the shy lesula is found is remote and sparsely populated, the researchers warn the monkey is vulnerable to extinction as a result of hunting for bush meat. They called for controls on hunting and the creation of a protected area covering its range to conserve the lesula and other wildlife found in the region.

It is well-known to hunters in the Lomami forest basin in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, but researchers said the area has had little biological exploration and the species was unknown to those outside the region. Lead researcher John Hart of Yale Universitys Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Lukuru Wildlife Research Foundation was not in the wild when he first spotted the curious monkey in 2007.

{"text": "(OurAmazingPlanet) A shy, brightly colored monkey species has been found living in the lush rainforests at the heart of the Democratic Republic of Congo, a find that utterly surprised the researchers who came upon it. \"When I first saw it, I immediately knew it was something new and different -- I just didn't know how significant it was,\" said John Hart, a veteran Congo researcher who is scientific director for the Lukuru Wildlife Research Foundation, based in Kinshasa. In fact, the find was something of a happy accident. Hart first spied the suspect monkey in 2007 while sifting through photographs brought back from a recently concluded field expedition to a remote region of central DRC. Yet the image that caught his eye hadn't been taken in the field. It was snapped in a village, and showed a young girl named Georgette with a tiny monkey that had taken a shine to the 13-year-old. [See Georgette and the monkey.] It was a gorgeous animal, Hart said, with a blond mane and upper chest, and a bright red patch on the lower back. \"I'd never seen that on any animal in the area, so right away I said, 'Hmmm,'\" he told OurAmazingPlanet. Hart decided to get to the bottom of the mystery. Fast forward through five years of field work, genetic research and anatomical study, and today (Sept. 12) Hart and a list of collaborators formally introduced to the world a new primate species, dubbed Cercopithecus lomamiensis, and known locally as the lesula. Their work is announced in the online journal PLOS One. It turned out that the little monkey that hung around Georgette's house had been brought to the area by the girl's uncle, who had found it on a hunting trip. It wasn't quite a pet, but it became known as Georgette's lesula. The young female primate passed its days running in the yard with the dogs, foraging around the village for food, and growing up into a monkey that belonged to a species nobody recognized. Further investigation revealed the full story of the strange monkey. It turned out that C. lomamiensis, a cryptic, skittish primate, roams a swath of dense rainforest some 6,500 square miles (17,000 square kilometers). \"For a big mammal to go unnoticed is pretty unusual,\" said Kate Detwiler, a primatologist and assistant professor at Florida Atlantic University, and an author on the paper. Yet one visit to the area that the lesula calls home reveals why the monkeys escaped scientific notice for so long, Detwiler told OurAmazingPlanet. This region of the DRC is remote and vast. The trees tower overhead, blocking out the sun, and the forest floor -- the chief domain of the lesula -- is steeped in a permanent gloom. The forest is full of sounds. At first light, the lesulas raise a lilting chorus of booming calls, distinct from the cries of their monkey neighbors who pass their lives in the trees high above the forest floor; at dusk, the cries of African grey parrots echo through the canopy. The earth is wet and soft, and feet sink into the ground with each step. There is a gentle, steady thud as fruit falls from the trees. One gets the feeling of being on a ship very far out to sea, Detwiler said - only here, the ocean is the endless expanse of the trees. \"I felt so privileged to be there,\" she said. \"I wish everybody could have that experience.\" The lesulas live in this isolated region in groups up to five strong, and feeds on fruit and leafy plants. The males weigh up to 15 pounds (7 kilograms), about twice the size of the females. They also have some rather arresting anatomical features. \"They have giant blue backsides,\" Hart said. \"Bright aquamarine buttocks and testicles. What a signal! That aquamarine blue is really a bright color in forest understory.\" [World's Freakiest Looking Animals] \"So in terms of monkey viewing, females can definitely find males,\" Detwiler said. \"We don't really know what this means because it's very uncommon for monkeys in this lineage,\" she added. The only other monkey to share this feature is the lesula's closest cousin -- the owl-faced monkey, a species that lives farther east. At first it was thought the monkeys were close kin, but genetic analysis suggests the two species split from a common ancestor about 2 million years ago. Now that the new species has been formally identified, Hart said, the next task is to save it. Although the lesula is new to science, it is a well-established sight on the dinner table. There's a thriving market for bush meat, particularly in urban areas, Hart said, and the monkeys are just one of dozens of species, from snakes to elephants to apes, that are targeted. \"People have disposable income, and this is the cheapest meat,\" he said. \"Bush meat is a go-to item because it's less expensive than chicken or beef. This is not a new problem, but it's a problem that doesn't have a solution yet.\" Hart and his wife, Terese, are partnering with local people to try to set up a national park in the lesulas' territory, but it's still a work in progress. In the meantime, researchers have set up camera traps in the dense forest to try to better understand the habits of the shy animals. Georgette, the girl whose lesula companion started it all, is now 18. \"The animal was very attached to her,\" Hart said.

{"text": "This bright little fellow is known as the lesula to the local people of a remote part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, and as of recently has been recognized as a new, distinct species of monkey. Lucky for the lesula, the discovery came in the nick of time for preservation efforts to be rolled, as the species faces extinction due to extensive hunting. Though the monkey bares a cunning resemblance to the owl-faced monkey, the lesula can be easily differentiated by its blond chin and upper chest, in contrast to its dark limbs. Also It has a reddish-colored lower back and tail. The first lesula found was a young captive animal seen in 2007 in a school directors compound in the town of Opala in the Democratic Republic of Congo. And adult males have a huge bare patch of skin in the buttocks, testicles and perianal area, said John A. Hart, the researcher who described the coloring. Its a brilliant blue, really pretty spectacular. Look closely in the lesulas eyes  doesnt it remind you of a person, a known figure of some kind? Well, some readers from CNN quickly jumped on the news and started making bets on who bares the greatest resemblance to the lesula. Finalists include David Schwimmer from Friends, Jake Gyllenhaal, da Vincis Mona Lisa or Jesus. Laughs aside, since it was first sighted, thorough tests and analysis were performed which revealed that indeed that the monkey is a genetically distinct species, now called Cercopithecus lomamiensis by its scientific name. Researchers are worried, however, concerning the lesulas fate as the new monkeys range covers one of Congos last biologically unexplored forest blocks. Although the scientists involved in the study were able to identify more lesulas in the wild, under the current trends of uncontrolled bush-meat hunting, it could become very endangered. After searching for several days in the most densely populated lesula habitat, I finally got a glimpse of the species on the last day in the forest,  said Florida Atlantic University (FAU) Assistant Professor of Anthropology Kate Detwiler. After the excitement of confirming the new species in the genetics lab, the chance to see the lesula in its natural habitat was especially gratifying. The fact that we are just finding a new species of primate in this area of the Congolese rain forest in the 21st century indicates that there is still so much to learn. We are very lucky that we found the lesula while there is still time to save it, and the discovery fuels the drive to raise awareness about and support for conservation of this incredibly diverse ecosystem. Indeed, as Professor Detwiler perfectly synthesizes, were in 21st century and still there are species, of monkeys even, which have yet to be identified.

Scientists have for the first time estimated that the Amazon is home to 16,000 different species of trees of which only 227 are hyper-dominant, accounting for half of Amazonias total trees. The team of researchers also found that the region was, in total, home to an estimated 390 billion trees. \"We think there are roughly 16,000 tree species in Amazonia, but the data also suggest that half of all the trees in the region belong to just 227 of those species, says Hans ter Steege, first author on the study and researcher at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in South Holland, Netherlands. Thus, the most common species of trees in the Amazon now not only have a number, they also have a name.

At least four people were killed and almost 50 were wounded in the attack, according to Lebanons National News Agency. Lebanon has seen repeated spillover violence from the three-year war in neighboring Syria, but with four bombings in the past month, fears have grown that Lebanon is entering a darker, bloodier period. I think it is the beginning, Dahieh resident  Abu Hassan told ABC News amid the crowd of hundreds who had gathered around the blast site, steps from his apartment. My children, I am keeping at home. I cant send them anymore. Its too dangerous. Responsibility for todays  attack was quickly claimed on Twitter by a group called Jabhat al-Nusra in Lebanon. The group bearing the same name in Syria is linked to al Qaeda and is one of the strongest rebel groups fighting the forces of President Bashar al-Assad. Hezbollah is fighting alongside Assads troops. A statement posted on Twitter said the attack was carried out to avenge Hezbollahs massacres of children and civilians in Syria. The war in Syria and Hezbollahs involvement in it has deepened sectarian divisions between Sunni and Shiite Muslims in Lebanon. The vast majority of the rebels fighting in Syria are Sunnis, while the Assad regime is predominantly Alawite, an offshoot of Shiism. Todays bombing was the second in the Haret Hreik district of the mostly Shia Dahieh neighborhood this month. Another car bombing was claimed by Sunni Jabhat al-Nusra last week in the northern, Shia town of Hermel. On Dec. 27, a car bomb in downtown Beirut targeted Mohammed Chattah, a former minister and vocal critic of the Syrian regime and Hezbollah. It was the first bombing in the center of the Lebanese capital since Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was assassinated almost nine years ago. Todays death toll could have been higher. An undetonated explosives belt was found by the Lebanese soldiers who secured the area, the army said in a statement. The explosion had resulted from the three mortar rounds rigged to the attackers car, weighing over 30 pounds each. We saw a car that was speeding. The driver was honking like a mad man, the owner of a corner shop across from where the attack happened told Lebanons Daily Star newspaper. Seconds later, we saw the explosion which sent the vehicle flying up in the air, he added. The bomber had stopped at the base of an apartment building before detonating his explosives. The buildings facade was charred, its windows and balconies shattered, littering the street with debris. A low-slung building across the street suffered similar damage.

{"text": "(CNN) -- A suicide car bomber killed four people and injured 27 others in a neighborhood in southern Beirut on Tuesday, Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported. Black plumes of smoke rose from Haret Hreik, which is known as a Hezbollah stronghold. Ambulances rushed to the scene, NNA reported. The neighborhood is part of Hezbollah's high-security area known as \"security square,\" and many of the Shiite Islamist group's leaders live there. Troops have formed a security perimeter around the area and deployed investigators to the blast site, the Lebanese army said in a prepared statement. The vehicle used in the attack was stolen, the army said. Cryptic claim A cryptic message claiming responsibility for the attack appeared on Twitter from a user with the name \"al-Nusra Front in Lebanon.\" It claimed to be affiliated with the Syrian al Qaeda affiliate with the same name. CNN cannot confirm the authenticity of the Twitter user or the claim. Al Nusra Front in Syria has not commented on the attack. The message did not contain details that are typical of claims of responsibility by well-established terrorist groups. Previous bombing In early January, four people died in Haret Hreik, and 77 more were injured, when a car bomb exploded, NNA reported. The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, a Sunni Islamist militant group, claimed responsibility for that attack, calling it the \"first small payment\" in a bigger push against the Lebanon-based Shiite militia Hezbollah. ISIS, which is an affiliate of the al Qaeda terrorist organization, is one of the rebel groups fighting to overthrow autocratic Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Hezbollah -- also considered a terrorist organization by the United States -- is fighting beside al-Assad's troops, who are trying to quash the rebellion in Syria.", "label": {"what": ["A suicide car bomber killed four people and injured 27 others in a neighborhood in southern Beirut"], "when": ["Tuesday"], "where": ["in a neighborhood in southern Beirut"], "why": ["fighting to overthrow autocratic Syrian President Bashar al-Assad"], "who": ["al-Nusra Front in Lebanon"], "damages": ["killed four people and injured 27 others"], "countermeasures": ["Troops have formed a security perimeter around the area deployed investigators to the blast site", "the Lebanese army said in a prepared statement"], "perpetrators": ["a user with the name al-Nusra Front in Lebanon"]}}

Flames were seen pouring from the facade of a multi-storey building, along with large plumes of smoke. The blast, in Arid Street in the southern Haret Hreik district, left at least 20 injured, reports say. There has been a spike in sectarian tension in Lebanon blamed on the conflict in neighbouring Syria. Hezbollah forces have been fighting in support of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria, while Lebanese Sunni Muslims tend to back the Syrian opposition. Hundreds of people gathered at the scene as Hezbollah's emergency services worked to extinguish the blaze. It is not clear what the target was, though there are Hezbollah offices close by. A group calling itself the al-Nusra Front in Lebanon put out a statement on Twitter claiming to be behind the attack in revenge for \"massacres\" perpetrated by Hezbollah. It is not clear what links the group has to the al-Nusra Front in Syria - an al-Qaeda-linked force fighting Mr Assad's government. Lebanon's Haret Hreik district is densely populated with many shops. Buildings were damaged and glass strewn over the street. Details of casualties are sketchy. But of the four deaths reported by Hezbollah's al-Manar TV, quoting Hezbollah officials, one is reported to be a woman. Body parts thought to be those of the suicide bomber were scattered at the scene, Lebanon's national news agency reported. Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati called a meeting of the government's emergency response committee. It is the latest of several recent explosions in Lebanon. Five people were killed and many others injured by a bomb blast on 2 January in the same Beirut district.

{"text": "(Reuters) - A suicide bomber killed four people on Tuesday in a residential district of southern Beirut known for its support of the powerful Shi'ite Muslim military and political movement Hezbollah, security sources said. Tensions from Syria's conflict have increasingly infected neighboring Lebanon. Hezbollah has sent fighters and advisers to help its ally President Bashar al-Assad, a member of the Shi'ite-derived Alawite minority, against mainly Sunni rebels. A Reuters reporter said she saw the remains of what appeared to be the suicide attacker as emergency workers transported wounded people from the blast site, less than 100 meters from where another bomb exploded this month. \"I was passing in the street and the explosion went off,\" a wounded man at a nearby hospital, Kamal Abdel Ali, said. \"I don't know how but I flew and fell to the ground.\" Flames erupted from a building and a thick plume of smoke billowed over the street near the charred remains of cars as a crowd gathered at the site of the attack. The blast occurred on a busy street of small shops and restaurants in the Haret Hreik area of the Lebanese capital's largely Shi'ite southern suburbs and fit the profile of previous attacks against Hezbollah targets claimed by Sunni militants. A Twitter account purportedly run by the Lebanese branch of the Nusra Front, a Syrian rebel group with links to al Qaeda, said it carried out the attack, but it was not possible to verify the claim. Hezbollah's strongholds in Lebanon have been hit by a string of rocket and bomb attacks, including one in Haret Hreik on January 2 that killed at least five people. Politicians in Lebanon, still struggling to recover from its own 1975-1990 civil war and without a fully functioning government since March, condemned Tuesday's bombing. \"Today it is clear that we are living through the latest episode in a series of organized terrorist acts which is targeting the stability and security of the country,\" caretaker Health Minister Ali Hassan Khalil told Lebanon's Al-Jadeed television. A STRING OF ATTACKS Security sources told Reuters that four people had died in Tuesday's attack and at least 20 more were wounded. The bombing was the third to target a centre of Hezbollah support this year. The first of those came less than a week after a car bomb killed former finance minister Mohamad Chatah, a critic of Hezbollah and Assad, and six others in Beirut. Officials from the Shi'ite movement often frame the attacks on their centers of support in Lebanon, as well as their involvement in Syria, as part of a broader struggle pitting regional and international powers against one another. In another sign of the Syrian conflict's spillover, fighting reignited in the northern city of Tripoli, where at least seven people have died since Saturday in fighting between factions who support different sides in Syria's civil war. A civilian was killed on Tuesday in clashes between the army and militants and two soldiers were wounded in the city, which is about 70 km (40 miles) north of Beirut, security and medical sources said. Rocket fire from Syria killed at least seven people in the border town of Arsal on Friday, a day after a suicide car bomber killed three people in Hermel, a largely Shi'ite town supportive of Hezbollah also near the border with Syria.

And on January 2, a suicide car bombing claimed by the jihadist Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) killed five people on the same street targeted on Tuesday. While the attacks appear to be targeting the Hezbollah, the victims have all been civilians. Lebanon has suffered a spike in violence since the war in Syria broke out, with the frequency of attacks rising in recent weeks.

{"text": "BEIRUT, Lebanon   A suicide bomber blew himself up early Tuesday in a neighborhood in south Beirut where the Shiite militia and political party Hezbollah holds sway, the most recent in a series of such attacks that have targeted civilian areas across Lebanon in recent months. Lebanon s National News Agency said the attack had killed four people and wounded more than 30. It took place in the Haret Hreik district, near where a car bomb killed five people this month. The attack signaled a further decline in the sense of security in the Lebanese capital. Lebanon, fragile in the best of times, has been strained by large numbers of refugees from the war in neighboring Syria, as well as rising political and social tensions because different parties in Lebanon back opposing sides in the Syrian civil war. Many of the bombings, including one last week in the town of Hermel, have targeted areas mostly populated by Shiites, who strongly support Hezbollah, which has sent fighters to support President Bashar al-Assad of Syria against rebels seeking to topple him. Many of Lebanon s Sunnis sympathize with the mostly Sunni rebels, and some have gone to join the fight in Syria. For weeks, local news media has been reporting that Lebanon s politicians were on the verge of forming a new cabinet to run the country, 10 months after the last one resigned. While a new government could improve matters, others fear that the recent violence is being carried out by radical groups not beholden to any of Lebanon s politicians. There have been some positive developments on the domestic and regional levels, but it is not enough to take care of this type of phenomenon,  Ali Fayyad, a Hezbollah member of Parliament, told Al Manar television. The only possible claim of responsibility so far was posted on a Twitter account purportedly belonging to a group called the Nusra Front in Lebanon, which is assumed to be a branch of a group in Syria that is affiliated with Al Qaeda. It remained unclear, however, whether the claim was legitimate and even whether the group had a genuine presence in Lebanon. The bomb shattered balconies and sent up a fireball and a cloud of smoke between two residential buildings, according to footage from a surveillance camera shown on local television.

{"text": "CAIRO X Lebanon's National News Agency says that four people were killed when a suicide bomber detonated a vehicle he was driving on a busy thoroughfare in Beirut's mostly Shi'ite southern suburbs. It was the fourth major explosion in the area, where influence is held by the pro-Syrian, pro-Iranian Hezbollah. A security camera on a building not far from the explosion showed a four-wheel drive vehicle blowing up amid traffic in the busy Beirut suburb of Haret Hreik. It was the fourth explosion to hit Beirut's mostly Shi'ite southern district in recent months. Gunfire erupted briefly, as rescue workers tried to evacuate victims of the blast from damaged residential buildings and gutted vehicles. Casualties were taken to nearby hospitals as security forces combed the area for details of the bombing. Caretaker Interior Minister Marwan Charbel told a news conference that there have been a number of security lapses in recent months, leading to bombings like this one. He goes on to argue that recent suicide bombings have become more sophisticated:  He sais this is the second bombing that he has seen in which a suicide bomber, wearing a suicide belt, has driven a bomb-laden vehicle that has blown up. This time, though, he notes, the bomb in the vehicle went off, but the driver's suicide belt did not explode. Hezbollah's al-Manar TV reported that the vehicle contained four mortar bombs that were joined together.  Another recent blast, which killed a prominent Sunni politician, is thought to have used more than twice that quantity of explosives. Jabha al-Nusrat claims responsibility The militant Islamic Jabha al-Nusrat group, which is fighting in Syria against forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, claimed responsibility for the blast on Twitter. The group said the bombing was retaliation for regime attacks on Syrian children and children in the Lebanese border village of Arsal. The bombing took place several hundred meters from the Hezbollah group's party offices. Acting Interior Minister Charbel insisted that the bomber failed in his attempt to attack the Hezbollah compound. Another bomber blew himself up earlier this month before reaching the building. Former Lebanese President Amin Gemayel told several Lebanese TV channels that action must be taken to stop militants and extremists from inciting religious and sectarian conflicts. He insisted that outside forces are trying to stir up trouble in Lebanon. In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said the United States condemns the attack in the strongest terms.  She said such abhorrent acts of terrorism undermine the peace and security the Lebanese people deserve. Analyst Riad Kahwaji, who heads the Institute for Near East and Gulf Military Analysis says spillover from the conflict in Syria and anger over Hezbollah's involvement in support of the Assad regime, has been limited by efforts by Lebanese leaders to contain the violence:  \"Strong measures taken by the Lebanese armed forces and security agencies, along with Hezbollah's measures, and efforts by various Lebanese parties, including the parties against the Syrian regime, have helped contain the situation and keep the spillover of Hezbollah's intervention [in Syria] limited to a bombing every now and then in some neighborhoods,\" said Riad Kahwaji.

{"text": "A car bomb ripped through a Shia neighbourhood in south Beirut on Tuesday, killing four people and sending plumes of smoke over the area in the latest attack to target supporters of Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group. It was the second bombing in the neighbourhood of Haret Hreik this month amid a series of attacks that have shaken Lebanon in a spillover of Syria's civil war into its smaller neighbour. The violence has targeted both Sunnis and Shias, and further stoked sectarian tensions that are already running high as each Lebanese community lines up with its brethren on opposing sides of the Syrian conflict. Tuesday's explosion shattered shop windows and set cars ablaze on a crowded commercial street. Footage broadcast by the Hezbollah-owned al-Manar television station showed medics hauling a man on a stretcher out of the area as flames engulfed a building. Debris littered the pavement. Lebanon is part of Syria's international refugee crisis The Lebanese Red Cross, in a statement to the state-run National News Agency, said that along with the four killed, 35 people were wounded in the explosion. A group known as the Nusra Front in Lebanon claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was in retaliation for Hezbollah's military support of President Bashar al-Assad's forces in Syria. The claim, which could not be independently verified, was posted on the group's Twitter account. Its name suggested ties to the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front in Syria, one of the most powerful rebel factions. 'Like every time' Lebanon's state media said a suicide car bomber was behind the attack. A security official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media, said the vehicle was stolen and packed with 20 kilograms of explosives. \"There was a car beeping, and then it exploded,\" an unnamed eyewitness told the Voice of Lebanon radio station. \"Then we saw people on the ground X like every time.\" Similar attacks have targeted Shia areas in Lebanon in recent months, apparently the work of Syria-based Sunni rebels or militant Islamist groups fighting to topple Assad who have threatened to target Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon in retaliation for intervening on behalf of his government in the conflict. On Thursday, a car bomb struck the northeastern Shia town of Hermel close to the Syrian border during rush hour, killing at least three people and wounding more than 20. And on Jan. 2, a bombing in Haret Hreik just metres from where Tuesday's attack occurred killed five people. Another attack in November targeted the Iranian Embassy and killed at least 23 people. Iran is the chief patron of Hezbollah and an ally of Syria. Lebanon's Sunni community has also been hit, most notably by a deadly double car bombing outside Sunni mosques in the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli in August. A December car bombing in Beirut killed prominent Sunni politician Mohammed Chatah. The attacks raise the spectre of a sharply divided Lebanon being dragged further into the Syrian conflict. Shortly after Tuesday's bombing, clashes broke out in the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli, killing at least one person, said the security official.

{"text": "The number of monarch butterflies hibernating in Mexico reached an all-time low in 2013, according to data collected by the WWF-Telcel Alliance and Mexicos National Commission for Protected Areas (CONANP). Surveys of forested area used by hibernating monarchs showed that just 1.65 acres of forest were inhabited by monarchs during December of 2013, a 44% drop from the same time the previous year. The findings represent the lowest area since surveys began in 1993. Forest area inhabited by monarchs in Mexico is used as an indirect indicator of the number of butterflies arriving from Canada and the United States each year following a migration of more than 2,500 miles. The butterflies spend November through March hibernating in Mexicos temperate forests. A number of factors have contributed to a sharp decline in monarch populations in recent years, including loss of reproductive habitat caused by land-use changes and reduction of milkweed (primary food source for monarch larvae ) from herbicide use; extreme climate conditions in Canada, the United States and Mexico; and deforestation and forest degradation in hibernation sites in Mexico. The combination of these threats has led to a dramatic decline in the number of monarch butterflies arriving to Mexico to hibernate over the past decade, said Omar Vidal, WWF-Mexico Director General. Twenty years after the signing of NAFTA, the monarch butterfly migration  a symbol of cooperation between our three countries  is in grave danger. WWF is calling on leaders of Canada, the United States and Mexico to agree on a plan at the North American Leaders Summit for immediate action to conserve the monarch migration. The Summit takes place February 19 in Toluca, Mexico. To carry out the monitoring, bi-weekly tours were conducted through the 11 sanctuaries with historical presence of monarch colonies, determining their location, the perimeter they occupied with spatial analysis software, and temperatures. \"Since 2003, in coordination with local communities and the Mexican Government, the Alliance WWF-Telcel supports forest conservation and sustainable development in the region for the benefit of the monarch, the locals, and the tens of thousands of tourists who visit the sanctuaries every year\", said Marcos Linares, Business marketing Deputy Director, Telcel. The vast majority of monarchs that arrive in Mexico grew up eating milkweed in the United States and Canada, according to Karen Oberhauser, professor at the University of Minnesota who has studied the monarch for more than 30 years, and is a leading scientist on this butterfly. Numerous lines of evidence demonstrate that the Corn Belt in the US Midwest is the primary source for monarchs hibernating in Mexico, said Oberhauser. Large part of the monarchs reproductive habitat in this region has been lost to changing agricultural practices, namely an explosion in the use of crops that allow post-emergence treatment with herbicides.

In addition to habitat degradation due to use of pesticides and herbicides, recent changes in federal law in Canada have significantly reduced protection of monarch butterfly habitat across Canada\", said Dr. Phil Schappert, Canadian butterfly conservationist and author who lives in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and that has worked and written on monarchs for decades. \"The promotion of the economy first practices, instead of sustainable land use practices, threatens monarch habitat, added Schappert. Mexican authorities effectively enforced efforts to protect the Monarch Reserve, particularly from 2007 to 2012. Those efforts, together with the decade-long financial support from Mexican and international philanthropists and businesses to create alternative-income sustainable projects and employment to local communities, resulted in the decrease of large-scale logging in the core zone of the reserve. \"Over the past 35 years Mexico has done everything to protect monarch butterfly hibernation sites, and even so the population continues to decrease. It is time that Canada and the United States implemented measures that protect the reproductive habitat and feeding grounds of this butterfly. Otherwise, this spiral of population decline will continue\", Schappert concluded. \"Considering the challenges faced by the monarch butterfly and the clear evidence that their populations are declining, it is vital to mobilize as many people as possible, and that our efforts are carefully planned to help this butterfly recover, so their wonderful migration can be appreciated for many more generations\", ended Oberhauser.", "label": {"what": ["The number of monarch butterflies hibernating in Mexico reached an all-time low in 2013", "The butterflies spend November through March hibernating in Mexicos temperate forests.", "The vast majority of monarchs that arrive in Mexico grew up eating milkweed in the United States and Canada", "the Corn Belt in the US Midwest is the primary source for monarchs hibernating in Mexico"], "when": ["in 2013", "during December of 2013", "in 1993", "February 19", "since 2003", "from 2007 to 2012"], "where": ["in Mexico", "from Canada and the United States", "in Mexicos temperate forests", "in Toluca, Mexico", "in Halifax, Nova Scotia"], "why": ["land-use changes and reduction of milkweed (primary food source for monarch larvae ) from herbicide use", "an explosion in the use of crops that allow post-emergence treatment with herbicides", "These genetically modified crops have resulted in the extermination of milkweed from many agricultural habitats", "use of pesticides and herbicides", "recent changes in federal law in Canada", "'The promotion of the economy first practices, instead of sustainable land use practices, threatens monarch habitat"], "who": ["the WWF-Telcel Alliance and Mexicos National Commission for Protected Areas (CONANP)", "Omar Vidal, WWF-Mexico Director General", "Marcos Linares, Business marketing Deputy Director, Telcel", "Karen Oberhauser, professor at the University of Minnesota", "Dr. Phil Schappert, Canadian butterfly conservationist and author"], "countermeasures": ["WWF is calling on leaders of Canada, the United States and Mexico to agree on a plan at the North American Leaders Summit for immediate action to conserve the monarch migration.", "bi-weekly tours were conducted through the 11 sanctuaries with historical presence of monarch colonies, determining their location, the perimeter they occupied with spatial analysis software, and temperatures.", "in coordination with local communities and the Mexican Government, the Alliance WWF-Telcel supports forest conservation and sustainable development in the region", "Mexican authorities effectively enforced efforts to protect the Monarch Reserve", "the decade-long financial support from Mexican and international philanthropists and businesses to create alternative-income sustainable projects and employment to local communities", "the decrease of large-scale logging in the core zone of the reserve", "Over the past 35 years Mexico has done everything to protect monarch butterfly hibernation sites", "It is time that Canada and the United States implemented measures that protect the reproductive habitat and feeding grounds of this butterfly.", "it is vital to mobilize as many people as possible, and that our efforts are carefully planned to help this butterfly recover"], "importance": ["the monarch butterfly migration  a symbol of cooperation between our three countries", "the locals, and the tens of thousands of tourists who visit the sanctuaries every year", "their wonderful migration can be appreciated for many more generations"], "threats": ["just 1.65 acres of forest were inhabited by monarchs during December of 2013, a 44% drop from the same time the previous year", "a sharp decline in monarch populations in recent years", "loss of reproductive habitat", "extreme climate conditions in Canada, the United States and Mexico", "deforestation and forest degradation in hibernation sites in Mexico", "Large part of the monarchs reproductive habitat in this region has been lost", "significantly reduced protection of monarch butterfly habitat across Canada"]}}
{"text": "A new report from the World Wildlife Fund and Mexicos National Commission for Protected Areas found that the number of monarch butterflies hibernating in Mexico dropped to its lowest level since records began in 1993. The insects make an epic journey of thousands of miles each year from Canada and the U.S. to spend November through March hibernating in Mexico's temperate forests. Clues that this year's numbers would be the continuation of a troubling trend have been in for months, with the new study bringing more grim proof that the monarch is in trouble. Using satellite and aerial photographs, the new study documented that 1.65 acres of forest were inhabited by monarchs during December of 2013, marking a 44% drop from the same time in 2012. \"Twenty years after the signing of NAFTA, the monarch butterfly migration  a symbol of cooperation between our three countries  is in grave danger,\" stated Omar Vidal, WWF-Mexico Director General. While the study focused on deforestation and forest degradation in monarch reserves that serve as their winter habitat, it points to a trio of perils contributing to declining numbers of monarchs. There are 3 primary threats to the monarch butterfly in its range in North America:  deforestation and degradation of forest by illegal logging of overwintering sites in Mexico; widespread reduction of breeding habitat in the United States due to land-use changes and the decrease of this butterfly's main larval food plant (common milkweed [Asclepias syriaca]) associated with the use of glyphosate herbicide to kill weeds growing in genetically engineered, herbicide-resistant crops; and periodic extreme weather conditions throughout its range during the year, such as severe cold or cold summer or winter temperatures. Other butterfly experts have pointed to these three factors as well, though Lincoln Brower, a professor of biology at Sweet Briar College who has studied the monarch migrations for decades, told the Washington Post's Brad Plumer that \"The most catastrophic thing from the point of view of the monarch butterfly has been the expansion of crops that are planted on an unbelievably wide scale throughout the Midwest and have been genetically manipulated to be resistant to the powerful herbicide Roundup.\" Another leading scientist who has spent three decades studying the monarch, Karen Oberhauser, professor at the University of Minnesota, added to this point, saying \"Numerous lines of evidence demonstrate that the Corn Belt in the U.S. Midwest is the primary source for monarchs hibernating in Mexico,\" and the region has been hit by the explosive use of Roundup-resistant crops. This has meant that milkweed, the host plant for the monarch caterpillar, is being wiped out from fields, something that Chip Ward, Director of Monarch Watch, has been documenting. \"These genetically modified crops have resulted in the extermination of milkweed from many agricultural habitats,\" added Oberhauser. Dr. Phil Schappert, a Canadian butterfly conservationist, added in a statement that \"'the economy first' practices, instead of sustainable land use practices, threaten monarch habitat\" in Canada, and urges his country and the United States to \"implement measures that protect the reproductive habitat and feeding grounds of this butterfly.

{"text": "MEXICO CITY (AP)  The stunning and little-understood annual migration of millions of Monarch butterflies to spend the winter in Mexico is in danger of disappearing, experts said Wednesday, after numbers dropped to their lowest level since record-keeping began in 1993. Their report blamed the displacement of the milkweed the species feeds on by genetically modified crops and urban sprawl in the United States, extreme weather trends and the dramatic reduction of the butterflies' habitat in Mexico due to illegal logging of the trees they depend on for shelter. After steep and steady declines in the previous three years, the black-and-orange butterflies now cover only 1.65 acres (0.67 hectares) in the pine and fir forests west of Mexico City, compared to 2.93 acres (1.19 hectares) last year, said the report released by the World Wildlife Fund, Mexico's Environment Department and the Natural Protected Areas Commission. They covered more than 44.5 acres (18 hectares) at their recorded peak in 1996. Because the butterflies clump together by the thousands in trees, they are counted by the area they cover. While the Monarch is not in danger of extinction, the decline in their population now marks a statistical long-term trend and can no longer be seen as a combination of yearly or seasonal events, experts said. The announcement followed on the heels of the 20th anniversary of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which saw the United States, Mexico and Canada sign environmental accords to protect migratory species such as the Monarch. At the time, the butterfly was adopted as the symbol of trilateral cooperation. \"Twenty years after the signing of NAFTA, the Monarch migration, the symbol of the three countries' cooperation, is at serious risk of disappearing,\" said Omar Vidal, the World Wildlife Fund director in Mexico. Lincoln Brower, a leading entomologist at Sweet Briar College in Virginia, wrote that \"the migration is definitely proving to be an endangered biological phenomenon.\" \"The main culprit,\" he wrote in an email, is now genetically modified \"herbicide-resistant corn and soybean crops and herbicides in the USA,\" which \"leads to the wholesale killing of the monarch's principal food plant, common milkweed.\" While Mexico has made headway in reducing logging in the officially protected winter reserve, that alone cannot save the migration, wrote Karen Oberhauser, a professor at the University of Minnesota. She noted that studies indicate that the U.S. Midwest is where most of the butterflies migrate from. \"A large part of their reproductive habitat in that region has been lost due to changes in agricultural practices, mainly the explosive growth in the use of herbicide-tolerant crops,\" Oberhauser said. Extreme weather  severe cold snaps, unusually heavy rains or droughts in all three countries  have also apparently played a role in the decline. But the milkweed issue now places the spotlight firmly on the United States and President Barack Obama, who is scheduled to visit Mexico on Feb. 19, with events scheduled for Toluca, a city a few dozen miles from the butterfly reserve. \"I think President Obama should take some step to support the survival of the Monarch butterflies,\" said writer and environmentalist Homero Aridjis. \"The governments of the United States and Canada have washed their hands of the problem, and left it all to Mexico.\" It's unclear what would happen to the Monarchs if they no longer made the annual trek to Mexico, the world's biggest migration of Monarch butterflies and the second-largest insect migration, after a species of dragonfly in Africa. There are Monarchs in many parts of the world, so they would not go extinct. The butterflies can apparently survive year-round in warmer climates, but populations in the northern United States and Canada would have to find some place to spend the bitter winters. There is also another smaller migration route that takes butterflies from the west to the coast of California, but that has registered even steeper declines. Oberhauser noted that some Monarchs now appear to be wintering along the U.S. Gulf coast, and there has been a movement in the United States among gardeners and home owners to plant milkweed to replace some of the lost habitat. But activists say large stands of milkweed are needed along the migratory route, comparable to what once grew there. They also want local authorities in the U.S. and Canada to alter mowing schedules in parks and public spaces, to avoid cutting down milkweed during breeding seasons. The migration is an inherited trait. No butterfly lives to make the full round-trip, and it is unclear how they remember the route back to the same patch of forest each year, a journey of thousands of miles to a forest reserve that covers 193,000 acres (56,259-hectares) in central Mexico. Some scientists think the huge masses of migrating butterflies may release chemicals that mark the migratory path and that if their numbers fall low enough, not enough chemical traces would remain and the route-marking might no longer work. The human inhabitants of the reserve had already noted a historic change, as early as the Nov. 1-2 Day of the Dead holiday, when the butterflies usually arrive. \"They were part of the landscape of the Day of the Dead, when you could see them flitting around the graveyards,\" said Gloria Tavera, the director of the reserve. \"This year was the first time in memory that they weren't there.\" Losing the butterflies would be a blow for people such as Adolfo Rivera, a 55-year-old farmer from the town of Los Saucos who works as a guide for tourists in the Piedra Herrada wintering ground. He said the butterflies had come later and in smaller numbers this year, a fact he attributed to a rainy winter. \"This is a source of pride for us, and income,\" Rivera said. Butterfly guide Emilio Velazquez Moreno, 39, and other farmers in the village of Macheros, located inside the reserve, have been planting small plots of milkweed in a bid to provide food for the Monarchs if they decide to stay in Mexico year-round, which he said some do. Sitting beside a mountainside patch of firs where the butterflies were clumping on the branches, Velazquez Moreno, a second-generation guide who has been visiting the butterflies since he was a boy, said \"we have to protect this.

{"text": "Migrating monarch butterflies are in \"grave danger,\" according to a report that shows their colonies in Mexico now occupy the smallest area since records began in 1993. The report is based on a survey of Mexico's Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve done in December 2013. The butterflies, which spend the winter hibernating in the reserve's forest, occupied only 1.65 acres (0.6 hectare) in December 2013a 44 percent drop from 2012, when the insects covered 2.76 acres (1.12 hectares) of land. The survey was conducted by the WWF-Telcel Alliance and Mexico's National Commission for Protected Areas. Though monarchs are found in many parts of the world, the migratory monarch is the most thoroughly studied, since it's the group that's most at risk. (Watch a video of monarch butterflies.) Omar Vidal, director general of WWF-Mexico, noted by email:  \"The monarch butterfly as a species is not endangered. What is endangered is its migratory phenomenon from Canada to Mexico and back.\" The number of migrating monarchs is plummeting for a few reasons:  widespread loss of a plant called milkweed, which their young rely on for food; extreme climate fluctuations in North America, including freezing temperatures and heavy rain; and deforestation. (Watch video:  \"Growing Up Butterfly.\") This could be bad news for many ecosystems because monarchs pollinate plants, including some that people rely on for food, such as corn. The decline is especially worrisome because it's been going on for three years. \"Data from previous time periods usually show a pattern of ups and downs,\" Karen Oberhauser, a monarch expert at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, said by email. She believes the survey may have even underestimated the population drop. Weighing in at 0.0095 to 0.026 ounces (0.27 to 0.75 grams), the monarch is noteworthy for its migration. Every autumn, millions fly south and west from southern Canada and the United States, stopping at sites along the way to breed and feeda process that takes thousands of miles and spans five generations. (Read more about great migrations.) Most adult butterflies live only about a month, but the fifth generation lives about seven to eight monthsthe time required to fly from Canada and the U.S. to central Mexico, according to the WWF. (See video:  \"Great Migrations:  Monarchs and Milkweed.\") That group ends up in the forests of the Mexican states of Michoacan and Mexico, where they hibernate before the cycle begins anew. (Read about the discovery of the monarchs' winter home in a 1976 issue of National Geographic magazine.) To complete the migration to Mexico, butterflies need to lay their eggs on a specific plant:  milkweed. Once hatched, monarch larvae eat milkweed leaves as their first meal. Milkweed is not a favorite of farmers, though. Once widespread throughout the U.S., the plant has seen its range fall 58 percent due to herbicide use, especially on corn and soybean fields. Another threat to butterflies is climate extremes, including the droughts, heat waves, and storms that have hit North America in recent years. For instance, monarch numbers were very low in 2005 and 2006 most likely because of a severe drought in the U.S. (Read more about extreme weather.) It's not easy, but there are ways to halt the decline by recruiting the help of all three North American countries, Oberhauser noted. For instance, incorporating milkweed into large-scale plantings wherever possibleincluding marginal lands like roadsidesis one strategy. North American gardeners can also contribute by planting milkweed and making their land more butterfly friendly.

{"text": "A new report, based on a December 2013 survey of Mexicos Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve, claims that migrating monarch butterflies are in grave danger. The butterfly colonies currently occupy the smallest area since records began in 1993. The butterflies spend their winter hibernating in the forest of the reserve. In December 2013, the butterflies only occupied 1.65 acres. National Geographic reports that this represents a 44 percent drop from 2012 when they covered 2.76 acres of land. Additionally, the Associated Press (AP) reports that at the peak of recorded populations, the butterflies covered more than 44.5 acres in 1996. Monarch butterflies are found in many parts of the world, including North and South America, Australia, New Zealand, and many South Pacific Islands. The most studied subspecies, however, is the migratory monarch, since it is the group at most risk. Monarch butterflies are found in many parts of the world, including North and South America, Australia, New Zealand, and many South Pacific Islands. The most studied subspecies, however, is the migratory monarch, since it is the group at most risk. The monarch butterfly as a species is not endangered. What is endangered is its migratory phenomenon from Canada to Mexico and back, noted Omar Vidal, director of WWF-Mexico, in an email to National Geographic reporter Christine DellAmore. There are a few reasons  why migrating monarch numbers are falling:  widespread loss of a plant called milkweed, which their young rely on for food; extreme climate fluctuations in North America, including freezing temperatures and heavy rain; and deforestation. The loss of these populations could spell disaster for many ecosystems because monarchs pollinate plants, including corn, that humans rely on for food. Researchers have been seeing this decline for the past three years. Data from previous time periods usually show a pattern of ups and downs, Karen Oberhauser, a monarch expert at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, told DellAmore. Oberhauser worries the survey may be underestimating the population loss. The monarch butterfly weighs in between 0.0095 to 0.026 ounces. The most noteworthy aspect of the insect, however, is the annual migration. Every autumn, millions of butterflies head south and west from Canada and the US, headed to Mexico. They stop at sites along the way to breed and feed. The butterflies who migrate one year are not the ones who arrived in Mexico the year before. The migration covers thousands of miles, and spans five generations of butterflies to complete. Most adult butterflies live only one month. The fifth generation, however, are different. They live approximately seven to eight months, which is just enough time to make the trip from Canada or the US to central Mexico where they hibernate in the Mexican states of Michoacan and Mexico. These hibernation grounds were discovered in 1976 by Dr. Fred A. Urquhart and a team of volunteers. Milkweed is a necessary ingredient in the monarchs lifecycle and migration. It is the only plant they will lay their eggs on, and the newly hatched larvae eat the plant as their first meal. The problem is that milkweed is not popular with farmers and ranchers because it is poisonous to livestock. The weed was once widespread throughout the United States, but today it only holds 58 percent of its historical range due to herbicide use, especially on corn and soybean fields. According to AP reporter Mark Stevenson, Lincoln Brower, a leading entomologist at Sweet Briar College in Virginia, wrote that the migration is definitely proving to be an endangered biological phenomenon. The main culprit, he wrote in an email to Stevenson, is now genetically modified herbicide-resistant corn and soybean crops and herbicides in the USA, which leads to the wholesale killing of the monarchs principal food plant, common milkweed. The butterflies are also threatened by climate extremes, such as the droughts, heat waves, and storms that have hit North America in recent years. Monarch numbers were very low in 2005 and 2006, which has been attributed to a severe drought in the US. The final threat to the butterflies is logging, both in Mexico and the US. Loss of habitat on both ends of the migration is squeezing the population into smaller and smaller areas. Oberhauser said there are ways to halt the decline by recruiting the help of all three North American countries, although she admits this will not be easy. She notes that one strategy would be incorporating milkweed into large scale plantings wherever possibleincluding marginal lands like roadsides. Gardeners in North America can also contribute to conservation efforts by planting milkweed and making their gardens more butterfly-friendly. Given the conservation challenges facing monarchs, its vitally important that we mobilize as many people as possible, Oberhauser said. Through our collective efforts, monarch populations can rebound, so that their migrations may be appreciated by many generations to come. The surveys results were announced shortly after the 20th anniversary of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), in which Canada, the US and Mexico signed environmental accords to protect migratory species such as the monarch. The butterfly was adopted as the symbol of the trilateral cooperation. President Obama is scheduled to visit Mexico on February 19, with events in Toluca, a city just a few dozen miles from the butterfly reserve. I think President Obama should take some step to support the survival of the Monarch butterflies, writer and environmentalist Homero Aridjis, who has been a lifelong proponent of the monarch, told Stevenson.

In 2012, these butterflies occupied about 2.94 acres. Each year, thousands of monarch butterflies travel over 2,500 miles to reach the temperate forests of Mexico. North American monarchs are the only known butterfly species to travel such a long distance, according to National Geographic. Several factors- such as climate change, loss of habitat, changes in agricultural practices- have contributed to the fall in the number of monarch butterflies. Farmers in the U.S are now using herbicides to fight milkweeds, which are a major food source for migrating monarchs. \"The combination of these threats has led to a dramatic decline in the number of monarch butterflies arriving to Mexico to hibernate over the past decade,\" said Omar Vidal, WWF-Mexico Director General, according to a new release. \"Twenty years after the signing of NAFTA, the monarch butterfly migration - a symbol of cooperation between our three countries - is in grave danger.\" \"The butterfly as a species isn't in danger of extinction,\" Vidal added, according to Washington Post. \"What is in danger of disappearing ... is the migration of the monarch from Canada through the United States to Mexico.\" Forest area is used as an indirect way of estimating the population size of the butterflies.

{"text": "MEXICO CITY, Mexico, January 31, 2014 (ENS)  Monarch butterflies are vanishing from the Monarch Reserve in Mexicos temperate forest where they spend November through March hibernating after migrating more than 2,500 miles from Canada and the United States. As new research shows that the number of monarchs hibernating in Mexico reached an all-time low in 2013, conservationists are urging all three countries to agree on a joint plan to keep the annual migration from fading into history. Hundreds of millions of monarch butterflies migrate from eastern North America to Mexico each fall to overwinter in the high elevation oyamel fir forests of the Transvolcanic Range of central Mexico. Monarchs are unable to survive freezing temperatures and those breeding in temperate regions must escape to moderate climates to reproduce the next season. Data collected by the nonprofit WWF-Telcel Alliance and Mexicos National Commission for Protected Areas, CONANP, show that just 1.65 acres of forest were inhabited by monarchs during December of 2013, a 44 percent drop from the same time the previous year and the lowest area since surveys began in 1993. Factors driving the steep decline originate in all three countries. First, the extent of monarch habitat has shrunk due to deforestation and forest degradation in 11 sanctuaries along the border between the states of Michoacan and the State of Mexico. Next, the primary food source for monarch larvae that emerge in the United States and Canada is disappearing. The common milkweed, Asclepias syriaca, is being wiped out by the glyphosate herbicides used on genetically modified crops, the researchers found. Finally, extreme climate conditions in Canada, the United States and Mexico are making the entire life cycle more difficult for monarchs. The combination of these threats has led to a dramatic decline in the number of monarch butterflies arriving to Mexico to hibernate over the past decade, said Omar Vidal, WWF-Mexico director general. Twenty years after the signing of NAFTA [the North American Free Trade Agreement], the monarch butterfly migration  a symbol of cooperation between our three countries  is in grave danger. The World Wildlife Fund is calling on the leaders of all three countries to agree on a plan for immediate action to preserve the monarch migration. The trilateral annual summit between the prime minister of Canada, and the presidents of Mexico and the United States, takes place February 19 in Toluca, Mexico. To carry out the monitoring of monarch numbers, bi-weekly tours were conducted through the 11 sanctuaries that have historically hosted monarch colonies, determining their location, the perimeter they occupied with spatial analysis software, and temperatures. During the second half of December 2013, the monitors registered seven Monarch butterfly colonies  three in Michoacan, four in the State of Mexico  that occupied 0.67 hectares:  five colonies (0.62 ha) inside the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve and two (0.05 ha) outside the reserve. This amounts to a 43.7 percent decrease compared to December 2012 (1.19 ha) and is the smallest area occupied by this butterfly in Mexican sanctuaries since 1993. Since 2003, in coordination with local communities and the Mexican Government, the Alliance WWF-Telcel supports forest conservation and sustainable development in the region for the benefit of the monarch, the locals, and the tens of thousands of tourists who visit the sanctuaries every year, said Marcos Linares, Business marketing Deputy Director, Telcel. Most monarchs that arrive in Mexico grew up eating milkweed in the United States and Canada, says Karen Oberhauser, a professor at the University of Minnesota who has studied the monarch for more than 30 years, and is a leading scientist on this butterfly. Numerous lines of evidence demonstrate that the Corn Belt in the U.S. Midwest is the primary source for monarchs hibernating in Mexico, said Oberhauser. But an explosion in the use of crops that allow post-emergence treatment with herbicides have killed off the milkweed plants. These genetically modified crops have resulted in the extermination of milkweed from many agricultural habitats, said Oberhauser. In addition to habitat degradation due to use of pesticides and herbicides, recent changes in federal law in Canada have significantly reduced protection of monarch butterfly habitat across Canada, said Dr. Phil Schappert, Canadian butterfly conservationist and author who lives in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and that has worked and written on monarchs for decades. The promotion of the economy first practices, instead of sustainable land use practices, threatens monarch habitat, warned Schappert. Mexican authorities have effectively enforced efforts to protect the Monarch Reserve, particularly from 2007 to 2012, say the conservationists. Those efforts, together with the decade-long financial support from Mexican and international philanthropists and businesses to create sustainable projects that create local jobs, has resulted in the decrease of large-scale logging in the core zone of the reserve. Says Chip Taylor, director of the nonprofit conservation group Monarch Watch, based in Kansas, Monarch butterfly populations are declining due to loss of habitat. To assure a future for monarchs, conservation and restoration of milkweeds needs to become a national priority. Schappert said now Canada and the United States must help or monarch migrations will disappear. Over the past 35 years Mexico has done everything to protect monarch butterfly hibernation sites, and even so the population continues to decrease, he said. It is time that Canada and the United States implemented measures that protect the reproductive habitat and feeding grounds of this butterfly. Otherwise, this spiral of population decline will continue.", "label": {"what": ["Monarch butterflies are vanishing from the Monarch Reserve in Mexicos temperate forest", "migrating more than 2,500 miles from Canada and the United States", "Hundreds of millions of monarch butterflies migrate from eastern North America to Mexico each fall to overwinter in the high elevation oyamel fir forests of the Transvolcanic Range of central Mexico.", "Monarchs are unable to survive freezing temperatures and those breeding in temperate regions must escape to moderate climates to reproduce the next season.", "Most monarchs that arrive in Mexico grew up eating milkweed in the United States and Canada", "the Corn Belt in the U.S. Midwest is the primary source for monarchs hibernating in Mexico"], "when": ["January 31, 2014", "November through March", "in 2013", "during December of 2013", "in 1993", "February 19", "During the second half of December 2013", "since 2003", "from 2007 to 2012"], "where": ["MEXICO CITY, Mexico", "from Canada and the United States", "from eastern North America to Mexico", "in the high elevation oyamel fir forests of the Transvolcanic Range of central Mexico", "in Toluca, Mexico", "in Halifax, Nova Scotia", "in Kansas"], "why": ["Factors driving the steep decline originate in all three countries.", "deforestation and forest degradation in 11 sanctuaries along the border between the states of Michoacan and the State of Mexico", "the primary food source for monarch larvae that emerge in the United States and Canada is disappearing", "extreme climate conditions in Canada, the United States and Mexico are making the entire life cycle more difficult for monarchs", "an explosion in the use of crops that allow post-emergence treatment with herbicides have killed off the milkweed plants", "These genetically modified crops have resulted in the extermination of milkweed from many agricultural habitats", "use of pesticides and herbicides", "recent changes in federal law in Canada have significantly reduced protection of monarch butterfly habitat across Canada", "The promotion of the economy first practices, instead of sustainable land use practices, threatens monarch habitat"], "who": ["the nonprofit WWF-Telcel Alliance and Mexicos National Commission for Protected Areas, CONANP", "Omar Vidal, WWF-Mexico director general", "the prime minister of Canada, and the presidents of Mexico and the United States", "Marcos Linares, Business marketing Deputy Director, Telcel", "Karen Oberhauser, a professor at the University of Minnesota", "Dr. Phil Schappert, Canadian butterfly conservationist and author", "Chip Taylor, director of the nonprofit conservation group Monarch Watch"], "countermeasures": ["conservationists are urging all three countries to agree on a joint plan to keep the annual migration from fading into history", "calling on the leaders of all three countries to agree on a plan for immediate action to preserve the monarch migration", "bi-weekly tours were conducted through the 11 sanctuaries that have historically hosted monarch colonies, determining their location, the perimeter they occupied with spatial analysis software, and temperatures.", "in coordination with local communities and the Mexican Government, the Alliance WWF-Telcel supports forest conservation and sustainable development in the region", "Mexican authorities have effectively enforced efforts to protect the Monarch Reserve", "Those efforts, together with the decade-long financial support from Mexican and international philanthropists and businesses to create sustainable projects that create local jobs", "Over the past 35 years Mexico has done everything to protect monarch butterfly hibernation sites", "It is time that Canada and the United States implemented measures that protect the reproductive habitat and feeding grounds of this butterfly."], "importance": ["the monarch butterfly migration  a symbol of cooperation between our three countries", "But an explosion in the use of crops that allow post-emergence treatment with herbicides have killed off the milkweed plants."], "threats": ["the number of monarchs hibernating in Mexico reached an all-time low in 2013", "just 1.65 acres of forest were inhabited by monarchs during December of 2013, a 44 percent drop from the same time the previous year and the lowest area since surveys began in 1993.", "the extent of monarch habitat has shrunk", "a dramatic decline in the number of monarch butterflies arriving to Mexico to hibernate over the past decade", "a 43.7 percent decrease compared to December 2012 (1.19 ha) and is the smallest area occupied by this butterfly in Mexican sanctuaries since 1993"]}}
{"text": "Have you noticed anything missing from your garden lately? Monarch butterflies, North Americas most recognized butterfly, are vanishing. According to a new report from the World Wildlife Fund, fewer Monarchs migrated in 2013 than in any year since researchers began keeping records two decades ago. Every winter, the orange-winged butterflies, whose habitat range stretches all along the west coast of North America, migrate more than 2,500 miles from southern Canada and the U.S. down into Mexico. Millions of monarchs take refuge from the cold in Mexicos temperate forests, holing up until March when they return to the north. But over the years, the Monarchs numbers have declined. World Wildlife Fund researchers, who have studied the annual Monarch migration since 1993, say several factors have contributed to the butterflys disappearance. The biggest influences are loss of habitat and reduction of milkweed, the Monarchs primary food source, along North Americas western shores. The combination of these threats has led to a dramatic decline in the number of monarch butterflies arriving to Mexico to hibernate over the past decade, Omar Vidal, the World Wildlife Fund director in Mexico, said in a statement. Twenty years after the signing of the [North American Free Trade Agreement], the monarch butterfly migration -- a symbol of cooperation between our three countries -- is in grave danger. Eighteen years ago, the Monarch butterflies, which clump together in trees by the thousands, occupied more than 44 acres of forest in central Mexico during their winter migration. In 2012, the butterflies covered just 2.93 acres of forest. Last year, the Monarchs space measured less than 2 acres -- a 44 percent decrease from the same time the previous year. The migration is definitely proving to be an endangered biological phenomenon, Lincoln Brower, a leading entomologist at Sweet Briar College in Virginia, told the Associated Press. The main culprit is now GMO herbicide-resistant corn and soybean crops and herbicides in the USA, [which] leads to the wholesale killing of the monarchs principal food plant, common milkweed. Monarch butterflies lay their eggs on milkweed plants. When the eggs hatch, the larvae feed off the plant. Researchers say that without milkweed, there are no butterflies. \"They can't lay eggs on anything else, Christopher Singer, founder of the nonprofit Live Monarch Foundation, said in a statement, according to the Christian Science Monitor. Can't lay it on a watermelon, can't lay it on a parsley plant.

Only 1.65 acres of Mexican forest was inhabited by hibernating monarchs in December of 2013, that's a 44 percent drop since only the year before. The numbers are the lowest they have been since the beginning of the annual survey in 1993. The number of hibernating monarchs in the forests of Mexico indicates how many of the insects have made the 2,500-mile migration from Canada and the U.S. A number of factors are believed to have led to the monarchs' recent decline. Their reproductive habitats and hibernation grounds have been greatly reduced; herbicides have killed a great deal of milkweed, which is primary food source for monarch larvae. Extreme climate conditions are also believed to have made an impact. \"The combination of these threats has led to a dramatic decline in the number of monarch butterflies arriving to Mexico to hibernate over the past decade,\" Omar Vidal, WWF-Mexico Director General, said in the news release. \"Twenty years after the signing of NAFTA, the monarch butterfly migration - a symbol of cooperation between our three countries - is in grave danger.\" WWF has asked that officials in Canada, Mexico, and the U.S. work out an emergency plan to save the dying species and preserve their migration.

{"text": "One of natures most beautiful sights is when a monarch butterfly comes fluttering into view. Monarchs are the only known North American butterfly to migrate south for the winter, hibernating and returning in the spring as birds do. However, a new report finds the number of these butterflies hibernating in Mexico reached an all-time low in 2013, possibly due to loss of habitat, climate change and the use of insecticides. The combination of these threats has led to a dramatic decline in the number of monarch butterflies arriving to Mexico to hibernate over the past decade, said Omar Vidal, World Wildlife Fund-Mexico director general. Twenty years after the signing of NAFTA, the monarch butterfly migration  a symbol of cooperation between our three countries  is in grave danger. Depending on just how far north they make their summer homes, the butterflies journey south can be a long as nearly 5,000 kilometers. Monarch butterflies that summer in eastern North America spend the winter in Mexico, while those living in the west winter in California. The report, released last week by the World Wildlife Fund, Telcel Alliance and Mexicos National Commission for Protected Areas (CONANP), surveyed Mexican forest areas known to be used by hibernating monarchs. Researchers found that only 6,677 square meters of forest area were populated by monarchs during December 2013. This finding shows a 44-percent drop from the same time in 2012, and represents the smallest area occupied by the monarchs since 1993, when these annual surveys began. The annual survey is used by researchers as a way to indirectly tally the number of butterflies that make the trip from the United States and Canada during the yearly migration. Using spatial analysis software, researchers toured 11 butterfly sanctuaries, that have historically been known to have a presence of monarch colonies, once every other week in order to determine the specific location of the butterflies and how much of the forest land they inhabited during their winter hiatus. Scientists have cited numerous factors that may have caused the dramatic drop in the number of monarchs in recent years. According to the report, some of the reasons for the population drop include:  \n\n  A loss of the monarchs reproductive habitat, which may have been caused by changes in land use\n\n  A decrease in the monarch larvaes primary food source  milkweed  due to the use of herbicide\n\n  Extreme climate conditions in Canada, the United States and Mexico\n\n  A loss of forest area (deforestation) as well as and forest degradation throughout the areas of Mexico known for hosting monarchs in the winter Officials from Canada, Mexico and the United States will meet Feb. 19 in Toluca, Mexico, for the North American Leaders Summit.

{"text": "The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria released a video Saturday of the third beheading of a foreign hostage, a British aid worker. The execution was a clear message to Britain, a vital ally of the United States as it builds an international coalition to target the militant group, which has made stunning advances across Syria and northern Iraq in recent months. The video shows the aid worker, David Cawthorne Haines, kneeling on a bare hill under the open sky, in a landscape that appears identical to where two American journalists were killed by the group in back-to-back-executions in the past month. In the moments before his death, the 44-year-old Mr. Haines is forced to read a script, in which he blames his countrys leaders for his killing. I would like to declare that I hold you, David Cameron, entirely responsible for my execution, he said. You entered voluntarily into a coalition with the United States against the Islamic State. He added:  Unfortunately, it is we the British public that in the end will pay the price for our Parliaments selfish decisions. The video ends with the black-clad executioner, who was speaking in English with what sounded like a British accent, identifying their next victim as Alan Henning, another British citizen. SITE Intelligence, which tracks jihadist groups, said the executioner appeared to be the same man who killed the American hostages. Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain called an emergency meeting of his top advisers Sunday morning. The British government said Saturday night that it was trying to verify the video, although Mr. Cameron later denounced the killing on Twitter, saying:  The murder of David Haines is an act of pure evil. My heart goes out to his family who have shown extraordinary courage and fortitude. We will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice, however long it takes. Britain and the United States are among the only nations in the world that have held to a hard-line, no-concessions policy when dealing with kidnappings by terrorist groups. President Obama, in a statement released Saturday, said the United States strongly condemned the barbaric murder of Mr. Haines. We will work with the United Kingdom and a broad coalition of nations from the region and around the world to bring the perpetrators of this outrageous act to justice, he said. The beheading of Mr. Haines puts pressure on the government of Britain, a member of a core coalition of nations announced as NATO leaders met in Wales this month and sought to devise a strategy to address the growing threat from ISIS, including plans to strengthen allies in Iraq and Syria and conduct airstrikes against the militants. Mr. Obama last week announced a major expansion of the military campaign against ISIS, including airstrikes against the group in Syria. The beheadings of the two Americans, James Foley, reported on Aug. 19, and Steven J. Sotloff, on Sept. 2, followed the start of a campaign of airstrikes against ISIS positions in Iraq. The group is currently holding Mr. Henning and another British citizen, as well as two other American aid workers. Their families have asked the news media not to disclose their names, after ISIS warned that the hostages would die if relatives made their identities public. Until earlier this year, ISIS was holding close to two dozen foreigners in the same jail where Mr. Haines was imprisoned, near the Syrian town of Raqqa. His European cellmates were released for ransom, according to one of the hostages held alongside him who was freed after his government paid a ransom. Mr. Haines, who had a military background, was kidnapped 19 months ago in northern Syria and was held alongside an Italian co-worker, Federico Motka. Both men worked for Acted, a French aid group, and had traveled to Syria during the countrys horrific civil war. Their fates diverged based on their countries policies:  Mr. Motka was released in May, one of 15 Europeans released from the same ISIS-run jail for a ransom, according to a person familiar with the hostages detention and release. Earlier this month, Mr. Cameron ruled out paying a ransom for Mr. Haines. Its a desperately difficult situation, he told Sky News. We dont pay ransoms to terrorists when they kidnap our citizens. The British news media respected a strict blackout, not revealing that Mr. Haines, a father of two from Perth, Scotland, was missing until the video of Mr. Sotloffs execution was released on Sept. 2, in which he is named as the next to be killed. Mr. Haines had been working as a security consultant for Acted when he was captured in a refugee camp in Atmeh, in northern Syria. On his LinkedIn profile, he wrote that he had 23 years of working experience in private, NGO and military environments, referring to nongovernmental organizations. Before Acted, Mr. Haines worked in South Sudan in 2012 for a Belgium-based organization, Nonviolent Peaceforce, which describes itself as an unarmed, civilian peacekeeping force and operates in South Sudan, Myanmar and the Philippines. He also worked as a country director for Handicap International, a disability charity, in Libya during the Arab Spring. During his captivity, he tried to hide his military background, a former hostage said, but like many of the others held in a cell in Raqqa, he was repeatedly tortured, one of his former cellmates said. In the video, his executioner makes reference to his background, indicating that they eventually found out:  This British man has to pay the price for your promise, Cameron, to arm the pesh merga against the Islamic State. Ironically, he has spent a decade of his life serving under the same Royal Air Force that is responsible for delivering those arms. He also held various positions in the military, according to his profile on social media sites. Mr. Hainess brother, Mike Haines, released a statement on Sunday saying that David had \"helped whoever needed help, regardless of race, creed or religion. David was most alive and enthusiastic in his humanitarian roles, he said. His joy and anticipation for the work he went to do in Syria is for myself and family the most important element of this whole sad affair. Mike Haines described a happy childhood with parents who loved us both and raised their sons \"to know right from wrong, although we might not with the innocence of youth have always chosen right. His brother, he said, worked with the Royal Mail before joining the Royal Air Force as an aircraft engineer. He later served with the United Nations in the Balkans, helping people in real need.

{"text": "BEIRUT (AP)  Islamic State extremists released a video showing the beheading of British aid worker David Haines, who was abducted in Syria last year, and British Prime Minister David Cameron late Saturday condemned his slaying as \"an act of pure evil.\" Cameron confirmed Haines' death in a statement after the British Foreign Office had said earlier that it was \"working urgently to verify the video.\" Haines is the third Westerner beheaded in recent weeks by the Islamic State group, which has seized vast swaths of territory in Syria and Iraq. \"This is a despicable and appalling murder of an innocent aid worker. It is an act of pure evil,\" Cameron said, adding that \"my heart goes out to the family of David Haines who have shown extraordinary courage and fortitude throughout this ordeal.\" \"We will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice, however long it takes,\" Cameron said. Cameron returned to his residence at 10 Downing Street shortly after midnight and is expected to chair a meeting of the government's emergency response committee early Sunday. The video emerged a day after Haines' family issued a public plea late Friday urging his captors to contact them. The Foreign Office said it was offering Haines' family \"every support possible. They ask to be left alone at this time.\" Islamic State militants recently beheaded two American journalists, James Foley and Steven Sotloff, and posted the videos online after the U.S. began launching airstrikes and humanitarian missions in August to aid waning Iraqi and Kurdish security forces in northern Iraq. The Islamic State group has also put out videos showing the beheading of Kurdish and Lebanese soldiers and the mass shooting of dozens of captured Syrian soldiers. At the end of the video showing the beheading of Sotloff, the Islamic State group threatened to kill Haines next and briefly showed him on camera. President Barack Obama issued a statement strongly condemning \"the barbaric murder\" of Haines by the Islamic State terrorist group. \"The United States stands shoulder to shoulder tonight with our close friend and ally in grief and resolve. We will work with the United Kingdom and a broad coalition of nations from the region and around the world to bring the perpetrators of this outrageous act to justice, and to degrade and destroy this threat to the people of our countries, the region and the world,\" Obama said. On Wednesday, Obama gave a nationally televised speech outlining a potential military campaign to \"degrade and ultimately destroy\" the Islamic State militants that is likely to include training and equipping moderate Syrian rebels and Iraqi forces, providing intelligence, and expanding airstrikes against extremists in Iraq and potentially into Syria. Britain was among the initial group of countries joining the U.S.-led coalition to root out the Islamic State extremists. In the video showing Haines' slaying, the group threatened to kill another British captive. Both British men were dressed in orange jumpsuits against an arid Syrian landscape, similar to that seen in the Foley and Sotloff videos. The SITE Intelligence Group, a U.S. terrorism watchdog, reported the video, which was also posted online by users associated with the Islamic State group. The video was entitled \"A Message to the Allies of America.\" Haines' killer, who appeared to be the same masked man speaking with a British accent and brandishing a knife as in the previous videos, tells the British government that its alliance with the U.S. will only \"accelerate your destruction\" and will drag the British people into \"another bloody and unwinnable war\". In the video, according to a transcript provided by SITE, Haines says that he holds Cameron \"entirely responsible for my execution\" because Britain has \"voluntarily entered into a coalition with the United States against the Islamic state.\" His killer says in the video that Haines was paying the price for Britain's decision to supply weapons to Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, who are battling the Islamic State group in northern Iraq. He references U.S. airstrikes against Islamic State fighters near the Haditha Dam in western Iraq, which the U.S. began targeting on Sept. 7  indicating that Haines' killing took place sometime during the past week. The British government had managed to keep Haines' kidnapping secret out of concern for his safety until the Sotloff beheading video identified him as a captive and the next victim. Late Friday, the family of Haines issued a public plea urging his captors to contact them. In a short statement released through Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the family said:  \"We are asking those holding David to make contact with us.\" Haines, 44, was abducted near a refugee camp in northern Syria in March 2013 while working for the French international aid agency ACTED which was helping thousands of Syrians displaced by the fighting between Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces and rebel groups, including the Islamic State, seeking to oust him. ACTED said in a statement earlier this month that Haines had worked with as an international aid worker since 1999, helping victims of conflict in the Balkans, Africa and the Middle East. Before heading to Syria, ACTED said Haines had worked in 2012 as a \"non-partisan unarmed civilian peace facilitator\" in South Sudan. Michael Rubin, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said the Islamic State group releases such videos because it has concluded that neither the American nor the European public has the stomach for a protracted conflict in which civilians are tortured and killed. \"Each video that's released, of course, is a propaganda coup, if you will,\" Rubin, a Pentagon official during the George W. Bush administration, told The Associated Press in an interview Saturday night. If the slaying of Haines took place in the last few days, Rubin said, the timing suggests that U.S. and other forces have no idea where the extremists are keeping their captives and that, in turn, means a lack of intelligence about what goes on within the group itself. Mike Haines said in a statement issued by the Foreign Office that his brother was devoted to humanitarian work. \"David was most alive and enthusiastic in his humanitarian roles,\" Mike Haines said. \"His joy and anticipation for the work he went to do in Syria is for myself and family the most important element of this whole sad affair. He was and is loved by all his family and will be missed terribly.\" British media have reported that Haines, who is married to a Croatian woman, was educated in Perth, Scotland, and spent 11 years serving in the British Royal Air Force before becoming an international aid worker. Britain's Press Association said Haines had a teenage daughter in Scotland from a previous marriage and a 4-year-old daughter from his present marriage.", "label": {"what": ["Islamic State extremists released a video showing the beheading of British aid worker David Haines", "has also put out videos showing the beheading of Kurdish and Lebanese soldiers and the mass shooting of dozens of captured Syrian soldiers"], "when": ["late Saturday", "early Sunday", "late Friday", "in August", "On Wednesday", "on Sept. 7", "in March 2013", "since 1999", "in 2012", "Saturday night"], "where": ["in Syria", "at 10 Downing Street", "online", "in north Iraq", "near the Haditha Dam in western Iraq", "in northern Syria", "in the Balkans, Africa and the Middle East", "in South Sudan", "in Perth, Scotland"], "why": ["the U.S. began launching airstrikes and humanitarian missions in August to aid waning Iraqi and Kurdish security forces in northern Iraq", "'its alliance with the U.S. will only 'accelerate your destruction' and will drag the British people into 'another bloody and unwinnable war'", "Haines says that he holds Cameron 'entirely responsible for my execution' because Britain has 'voluntarily entered into a coalition with the United States against the Islamic state.'", "Haines was paying the price for Britain's decision to supply weapons to Kurdish Peshmerga fighters", "because it has concluded that neither the American nor the European public has the stomach for a protracted conflict in which civilians are tortured and killed", "'Each video that's released, of course, is a propaganda coup, if you will,'"], "who": ["British Prime Minister David Cameron", "The Foreign Office", "two American journalists, James Foley and Steven Sotloff", "President Barack Obama", "The SITE Intelligence Group, a U.S. terrorism watchdog", "the British government", "Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office", "Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces", "Michael Rubin, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute", "The Associated Press", "Mike Haines", "Britain's Press Association"], "damages": ["Haines is the third Westerner beheaded in recent weeks", "the Islamic State group threatened to kill Haines next and briefly showed him on camera", "the Sotloff beheading video identified him as a captive and the next victim", "the timing suggests that U.S. and other forces have no idea where the extremists are keeping their captives and that, in turn, means a lack of intelligence about what goes on within the group itself."], "countermeasures": ["condemned his slaying as 'an act of pure evil.'", "Cameron confirmed Haines' death in a statement after the British Foreign Office had said earlier that it was 'working urgently to verify the video.'", "'We will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice, however long it takes,' Cameron said.", "is expected to chair a meeting of the government's emergency response committee", "Haines' family issued a public plea late Friday urging his captors to contact them", "offering Haines' family 'every support possible", "strongly condemning 'the barbaric murder' of Haines", "'We will work with the United Kingdom and a broad coalition of nations from the region and around the world to bring the perpetrators of this outrageous act to justice, and to degrade and destroy this threat to the people of our countries, the region and the world,'", "Obama gave a nationally televised speech outlining a potential military campaign to 'degrade and ultimately destroy' the Islamic State militants that is likely to include training and equipping moderate Syrian rebels and Iraqi forces, providing intelligence, and expanding airstrikes against extremists in Iraq and potentially into Syria.", "The British government had managed to keep Haines' kidnapping secret out of concern for his safety"], "perpetrators": ["the Islamic State group", "Islamic State militants", "the Islamic State terrorist group", "the Islamic State extremists", "the same masked man speaking with a British accent and brandishing a knife as in the previous videos"]}}
{"text": "The brutal band of Sunni jihadists released a video Saturday showing the beheading of a British aid worker  a cold-blooded execution his nations Prime Minister David Cameron labeled an act of pure evil. The gruesome 2-minute, 27-second clip shows David Haines, 44, kneeling on a sandy hill while a black-clad executioner stands behind him clutching a knife. Before hes slain, Haines reads from a script, blaming Cameron for his murder. The setting and script are similar to those used in the beheadings of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff. My name is David Cawthorne Haines, he says. I would like to declare that I hold you, David Cameron, entirely responsible for my execution. You entered voluntarily into a coalition with the United States against the Islamic State, just as your predecessor Tony Blair did, following a trend amongst our British prime ministers who cant find the courage to say no to the Americans. Unfortunately, it is we the British public that in the end will pay for the price for our parliaments selfish decisions. Then the executioner  who appears to be the same monster responsible for killing Foley and Sotloff  speaks directly into the camera in a now-familiar British accent. This British man has to pay the price for your promise, Cameron, to arm the Peshmerga against the Islamic State, hisses the terrorist known as Jihadi John. Ironically, he has spent a decade of his life serving under the brutal air force that is responsible for delivering those arms. Your evil alliance with America, which continues to strike the Muslims of Iraq and most recently bombed the Haditha Dam, will only accelerate your destruction, and playing the role of the obedient lap dog, Cameron, will only drag you and your people into another bloody and unwinnable war. The video  titled A Message to the Allies of America  ends ominously. The executioner is shown standing over and grabbing the collar of another captured Brit, Alan Henning. If you, Cameron, insist on fighting the Islamic State, then you, like your master, Obama, will have the blood of your people on your hands, the deranged terrorist says. Haines brother said his brave sibling, a married father of two who dedicated much of his life to helping the suffering, was murdered in cold blood. After a stint with the British Royal Air Force, Haines provided aid to conflict victims in the Balkans, Africa and the Middle East. David was most alive and enthusiastic in his humanitarian roles, Mike Haines said in a statement. His joy and anticipation for the work he went to do in Syria is for myself and family the most important element of this whole sad affair.\" He was and is loved by all his family and will be missed terribly. In a statement, Cameron said the execution of Haines was despicable and appalling. He added, My heart goes out to the family of David Haines who have shown extraordinary courage and fortitude throughout this ordeal.\" We will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice, however long it takes. The prime minister stated we have to confront the menace and would work to dismantle and destroy ISIS in a calm, deliberate way - but with an iron determination. We are a peaceful people. We do not seek out confrontation. But we need to understand. We cannot ignore this threat to our security and that of our allies, he said. The nation's Foreign Office released a statement Sunday that \"all signs are the video is genuine.\" Downing Street announced early Sunday that Cameron will preside over an emergency meeting of his top security officials to discuss Britains next step.\n\nPresident Obama condemned Haines barbaric murder. Our hearts go out to the family of Mr. Haines and to the people of the United Kingdom, Obama said in a Saturday night statement. We will work with the United Kingdom and a broad coalition of nations from the region and around the world to bring the perpetrators of this outrageous act to justice, and to degrade and destroy this threat to the people of our countries, the region and the world. In addition to Henning, the ISIS extremists are believed to be holding captive another British citizen, as well as two other American aid workers. The families of the kidnapped asked the news media not to reveal the captives names because ISIS warned they would be killed if relatives made their identities public, The New York Times reported. The video showing Haines murder was posted to Twitter hours after his family made a public plea for mercy early Saturday. We are the family of David Haines, their statement began. We are asking those holding David to make contact with us. Haines was taken hostage in Syria in March 2013, while working with a group to assist tens of thousands of refugees displaced by the countrys three-year civil war. He was traveling to the Turkish border when gunmen shot out the tires of the car he was riding in, surrounded the vehicle and took him and an Italian colleague hostage.\n\nHis wife has spoken out about his capture. Hes our life. Hes a fantastic man and father, Dragana Haines told the Telegraph. Nobody can understand how we are feeling. My daughter keeps asking about him every day. ISIS beheaded Foley in August, vowing to murder Sotloff, 31, if U.S. strikes in Iraq continued. A video showing Sotloffs beheading was released on Sept. 2, despite televised pleas from his mother asking for mercy for her son. At the end of the Sotloff video, an image of Haines was shown with a terrorist, who vowed he would be next.

{"text": "(CNN)  British aid worker David Haines appears to have been executed by ISIS militants, according to a video posted Saturday to a website associated with the group, making him the third Western captive to be killed by the Islamist extremist group in recent weeks. The ISIS video post showing Haines apparent beheading called his execution a message to the allies of America. It is produced very similarly to the videos that showed the executions of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, the last of which included Haines and the threat that hed be killed next. The new video pictures a masked ISIS militant placing his hand on another captive, whom he identified as Alan Henning, a British citizen. When contacted by CNN, the British Foreign Office said that it was analyzing the video. News of the apparent gruesome killing came the same day that Haines family released a brief message to his captors through the British Foreign Office. In it, the family says, We have sent messages to you to which we have not received a reply. We are asking those holding David to make contact with us. A logistics and security manager for the Paris-based Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development, a nongovernmental humanitarian agency, the 44-year-old Haines was abducted in March 2013 near a refugee camp in Atmeh, Syria. At that time, Haines was working to arrange for the delivery of humanitarian aid to people staying at the camp. He had previously worked on aid operations for victims of conflict in the Balkans, African and other parts of the Middle East, according to an ACTED spokesman. Haines face became known to the world in the ISIS video, released September 2, in which he looks forward and kneels as a masked ISIS militant stands behind him. The militant says in that video, We take this opportunity to warn those governments whove entered this evil alliance of America against the Islamic State to back off and leave our people alone. British officials said after the videos release that they had sent troops to try to rescue an unidentified British citizen some time ago, but failed. They released no other details. ISIS, which also calls itself the Islamic State, has killed thousands in Syria and Iraq as it presses a military campaign to establish itself as an Islamic caliphate. Witnesses report mass killings, beheadings and crucifixions. The United States has been using airstrikes to support Iraqi and Kurdish forces battling ISIS, and is working to build a coalition to broaden the effort against ISIS.

{"text": "The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria released a video Saturday of the third beheading of a foreign hostage, a British aid worker. The execution was a clear message to Britain, a vital ally of the United States as it builds an international coalition to target the militant group, which has made stunning advances across Syria and northern Iraq in recent months. Terrorist group ISIS released a video Saturday purportedly showing the execution of British aid worker David Cawthorne Haines. If confirmed, it is the third time the organization, which has seized large swaths of Iraq and Syria, beheaded a captive and released a video of the execution, intending to send a message to Western nations. Britain recently said it would send machine guns and ammunition to Iraq to help that government battle the militants, and it is weighing whether to participate along with the U.S. in possible airstrikes in Syria against the terror group. Haines, 44, like others in taped executions by the terror group, is forced in the new video to read a script in which he blamed his death on British Prime Minister David Cameron and the British governments decision to join the U.S. in its battle against ISIS. A black-clad, masked militant holding a knife then says the execution is in retaliation for Britains decision to supply arms to Kurdish fighters battling ISIS in Iraq. After the murder, another captive is shown and the executioner warns Cameron \"you ... will have the blood of your people on your hands, if the U.K. continues to ally with the U.S. in its campaign against the group. Cameron called the execution \"an act of pure evil.\" \"This is a despicable and appalling murder of an innocent aid worker. It is an act of pure evil. My heart goes out to the family of David Haines who have shown extraordinary courage and fortitude throughout this ordeal,\" the prime minister said. \"We will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice, however long it takes,\" Cameron added. President Barack Obama said, \"The United States strongly condemns the barbaric murder of UK citizen David Haines and offered his condolences to the family and the country.

We will work with the United Kingdom and a broad coalition of nations from the region and around the world to bring the perpetrators of this outrageous act to justice, and to degrade and destroy this threat to the people of our countries, the region and the world, Obama said in a statement. Haines, a father of two, was reported abducted in early 2013 in Syria while working for an aid group. His brother, Mike Haines, said in a statement that David was \"murdered in cold blood.\" He remembered the former Royal Air Force aircraft engineer and humanitarian worker as \"just another bloke\" and a \"good brother\" who adored his children. \"David was most alive and enthusiastic in his humanitarian roles. His joy and anticipation for the work he went to do in Syria is for myself and family the most important element of this whole sad affair,\" Mike Haines said in a statement on behalf of the family. \"He was and is loved by all his family and will be missed terribly.\" The statement said David Haines participated in United Nations missions in the Balkans, and those experiences made him want to pursue humanitarian work.

The terrorist organization Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, ISIS, released a video on Saturday titled A Message to the Allies of America, showing the beheading of British aid worker David Cawthorne Haines. Haines is seen kneeling on a bare hill in a landscape that appears identical to where two American journalists, James Foley and Steven Sotloff, were also beheaded. Some US officials believe that the Sotloff, Foley and Haines beheadings may have been carried out at the same time and released weeks apart to increase their impact. Haines, who was 44, was kidnapped last year while working for French humanitarian aid agency ACTED in Syria in March 2013. He had been in Syria for just three days when he was kidnapped, reportedly by a rebel group who later sold him to ISIS. In the moments before his death, Mr. Haines, 44, like the two journalists killed before him, reads a script in which he blames his countrys leaders for his killing. My name is David Cawthorne Haines. I would like to declare that I hold you, David Cameron, entirely responsible for my execution. You entered voluntarily into a coalition with the United States against the Islamic State, just as your predecessor Tony Blair did, following a trend amongst our British prime ministers who cant find the courage to say no to the Americans. Unfortunately, it is we, the British public that, in the end, will pay the price for our Parliaments selfish decisions. This British man has to pay the price for your promise, Cameron, to arm the peshmerga against the Islamic State. Ironically, he has spent a decade of his life serving under the same Royal Air Force responsible for delivering those arms. Your evil alliance with America which continues to strike the Muslims of Iraq and most recently bombed the Haditha Dam, will only accelerate your destruction, and playing the role of the obedient lapdog, Cameron, will only draw you and your people into another bloody and un-winnable war. The end of the video shows the militant placing his hand on another captive, identified as British citizen Alan Henning, and saying, If you, [David] Cameron, persist in fighting the Islamic State, then you, like your master Obama, will have the blood of your people on your hands. Middle Eastern journalist Harald Doornbos provided some information about Henning from a Syrian ex-prisoner source, tweeting that he is an aid worker from the Manchester-area who was working for a Muslim NGO in the UK.

{"text": "Militants with the Islamic State jihadi group have released a video that appears to show the beheading of a British hostage, David Haines, an aid worker who was captured just days after he arrived in Syria last year. British government officials were seeking to authenticate the video which purported to show the final moments of Haines, who was 44. In the video, entitled A Message to the Allies of America, a masked man is shown carrying out the beheading of Haines, whose life had earlier been threatened in a film showing the murder of American journalist Steven Sotloff. The video, which runs to two minutes and 28 seconds, ends with a warning that a second British hostage would be the next to die. He has been named in international media and on social media as Alan Henning, a British aid worker. Haines is the third western hostage and the first Briton to be killed in this fashion by Isis  the first, US journalist James Foley, was murdered in a video released on 19 August. The British prime minister, David Cameron, issued a statement denouncing the killing. This is a despicable and appalling murder of an innocent aid worker. It is an act of pure evil. My heart goes out to the family of David Haines who have shown extraordinary courage and fortitude throughout this ordeal. We will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice, however long it takes. Cameron will gather senior representatives of the military and security services and the Foreign Office and Home Office in Whitehall to discuss the situation. The US president, Barack Obama, also condemned the killing. The United States strongly condemns the barbaric murder of UK citizen David Haines by the terrorist group Isil, he said, using his administrations preferred acronym for Isis. Our hearts go out to the family of Mr Haines and to the people of the United Kingdom. The United States stands shoulder to shoulder tonight with our close friend and ally in grief and resolve. We will work with the UK and a broad coalition of nations from the region and around the world to bring the perpetrators of this outrageous act to justice, and to degrade and destroy this threat to the people of our countries, the region and the world. The recording features a voiceover delivered by an Isis militant, whose voice and accent closely resembles that of the killer in both the Sotloff and Foley videos. The killer directly addresses Cameron, saying that Haines has to pay the price for your promise to arm Kurdish peshmerga fighters against Isis. Speaking to the camera, the hostage, composed but clearly under duress, and wearing an orange jumpsuit, reads out a statement in which he says that Cameron is entirely responsible for my execution for entering into a coalition with the US. Haines, who was in the Royal Air Force for 12 years before moving into aid work, addresses Cameron, saying:  You entered voluntarily into a coalition with the United States against the Islamic State, just as your predecessor, Tony Blair, did, following a trend amongst our British prime ministers who cant find the courage to say no to the Americans. Unfortunately, it is we, the British public, that will in the end pay the price for our parliaments selfish decisions. The killer, swathed in black, then makes a statement in which he makes a direct reference to the British governments aid to Kurdish fighters. He says:  This British man has to pay the price for your promise, Cameron, to arm the peshmerga against the Islamic State. Ironically, he has spent a decade of his life serving under the same Royal Air Force that is responsible for delivering those arms. Your evil alliance with America which continues to strike the Muslims of Iraq and most recently bombed the Haditha dam will only accelerate your destruction. And playing the role of the obedient lapdog, Cameron, will only drag you and your people into another bloody and unwinnable war. At the end of the latest video, another hostage, Henning, is paraded. The US carried out at least nine air strikes last week on Isis militants threatening the Haditha dam. The bombing was cited by Hainess killer in the video. A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office in London said:  We are aware of the video and are working urgently to verify the contents. Isis had threatened to kill Haines, a father of two, in a video that emerged 11 days ago in which Sotloff was murdered. Less than 24 hours before the latest video emerged, the Haines family had made a plea to the jihadis to respond to their efforts to make contact. The family statement, which was released by the Foreign Office and addressed the militants directly, said:  We are the family of David Haines. We have sent messages to you to which we have not received a reply. We are asking those holding David to make contact with us. Haines was born in East Yorkshire but raised in Perthshire, and before his capture was living in Croatia with his second wife Dragana. He had a 17-year-old daughter with his first wife Louise, and a four-year-old daughter with Dragana, who has described him as a fantastic man and father. He was kidnapped while working for the aid organisation Acted, having previously worked in Libya and South Sudan. A meeting of the British governments emergency committee, Cobra, is expected to be called imminently and the prime ministers attentions will be diverted from the referendum on Scottish independence, due to take place on Thursday. Haines had worked for aid agencies in some of the worlds worst trouble spots, including Libya and South Sudan. He was in Libya during its civil war in 2011, working as head of mission for Handicap International, which helps disabled people in poverty and conflict zones around the world.", "label": {"what": ["Militants with the Islamic State jihadi group have released a video that appears to show the beheading of a British hostage", "At the end of the latest video, another hostage, Henning, is paraded.", "He was kidnapped while working for the aid organisation Acted"], "when": ["on 19 August", "on Thrusday", "in 2011"], "where": ["in Syria", "in international media and on social media", "in the Royal Air Force", "in London", "in East Yorkshire", "in Libya and South Sudan"], "why": ["The killer directly addresses Cameron, saying that Haines has to pay the price for your promise to arm Kurdish peshmerga fighters against Isis.", "entering into a coalition with the US", "following a trend amongst our British prime ministers who cant find the courage to say no to the Americans.", "it is we, the British public, that will in the end pay the price for our parliaments selfish decisions.", "the British governments aid to Kurdish fighters", "Cameron, to arm the peshmerga against the Islamic State", "continues to strike the Muslims of Iraq and most recently bombed the Haditha dam", "The US carried out at least nine air strikes last week on Isis militants threatening the Haditha dam."], "who": ["David Haines", "British government officials", "a masked man", "American journalist Steven Sotloff", "Alan Henning, a British aid worker", "the first, US journalist James Foley", "The British prime minister, David Cameron", "The US president, Barack Obama", "The United States", "Tony Blair", "Kurdish fighters", "A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office in London", "the Haines family", "the Foreign Office", "A meeting of the British governments emergency committee, Cobra"], "damages": ["the prime ministers attentions will be diverted from the referendum on Scottish independence", "a second British hostage would be the next to die"], "countermeasures": ["The British prime minister, David Cameron, issued a statement denouncing the killing.", "We will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice, however long it takes.", "Cameron will gather senior representatives of the military and security services and the Foreign Office and Home Office in Whitehall to discuss the situation.", "We will work with the UK and a broad coalition of nations from the region and around the world to bring the perpetrators of this outrageous act to justice, and to degrade and destroy this threat to the people of our countries, the region and the world.", "We are aware of the video and are working urgently to verify the contents.", "the Haines family had made a plea to the jihadis to respond to their efforts to make contact."], "perpetrators": ["Militants with the Islamic State jihadi group", "the terrorist group Isil", "an Isis militant"]}}
{"text": "LONDON  Islamic State militants on Saturday released a video showing the execution of British aid worker David Haines in the same grisly manner as the killing of two American journalists in recent weeks, along with a threat to kill another Briton. The video, titled A Message to Allies of America, shows Haines clad in an orange jump-suit kneeling beside a man who speaks in the same London-accented English as the apparent executioner in two previous videos. The masked man addresses British Prime Minister David Cameron, telling him that the killing is retribution for your evil alliance with America, which continues to strike the Muslims of Iraq. The video ends with a threat to kill a man, Alan Henning, who the Islamic State claimed is another British hostage of the terrorist group. Cameron tweeted a statement late Saturday saying that the murder of David Haines is an act of pure evil. My heart goes out to his family who have shown extraordinary courage and fortitude. Cameron also vowed to do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice, however long it takes. The killing of Haines, a 44-year-old father of two from Scotland who was working for the French aid agency ACTED, is likely to intensify calls in Britain for more direct action against the Islamic State. Britain has previously said it is sending arms to Kurdish fighters battling the group and is supporting American airstrikes with surveillance and intelligence. Britain has so far refrained from carrying out airstrikes itself. But Cameron and his allies have suggested that they might be open to direct British military intervention. The video of Hainess killing, which was first reported by the SITE Intelligence Group, was released just days after President Obama gave a prime-time speech from the White House in which he described an open-ended campaign to combat the Islamic State both in Iraq and in Syria. The president said the United States would work in concert with a broad coalition of allies, including Britain. Obama released a statement late Saturday condemning Hainess killing:  Our hearts go out to the family of Mr. Haines and to the people of the United Kingdom. The United States stands shoulder to shoulder tonight with our close friend and ally in grief and resolve. The Islamic State has released two previous videos showing the execution of the American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff. The group threatened to kill Haines at the end of the Sotloff video, which was released less than two weeks ago. On Friday, Hainess family urged his captors to contact them.\n\nWe have sent messages to you to which we have not received a reply, the family statement said. We are asking those holding David to make contact with us. Haines was abducted in March 2013 near the Atmeh refugee camp along the Turkish border in the Syrian province of Idlib. He was a veteran of the Royal Air Force, and since leaving the armed forces he had used his security expertise to work for aid agencies in conflict zones. The British newspaper the Telegraph quoted his wife, Dragana Haines, as saying last week that their 4-year-old daughter had been asking about her father every day for the past year and a half. Hes everything to us. Hes our life. Hes a fantastic man and father, she told the newspaper in an account published early Sunday. Nobody can understand how we are feeling. Hainess brother, Mike Haines, released a statement early Sunday saying David Haines was and is loved by all his family and will be missed terribly. Mike Haines said his brother had been an aircraft engineer with the Royal Air Force, and after leaving, had been energized by a new career working for aid groups in conflict zones. David was most alive and enthusiastic in his humanitarian roles, said the statement, which was released via the British Foreign Office. His joy and anticipation for the work he went to do in Syria is for myself and family the most important element of this whole sad affair.", "label": {"what": ["Islamic State militants on Saturday released a video showing the execution of British aid worker David Haines in the same grisly manner as the killing of two American journalists in recent weeks, along with a threat to kill another Briton.", "Haines was abducted in March 2013 near the Atmeh refugee camp", "The Islamic State has released two previous videos showing the execution of the American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff.

{"text": "(CNN) -- British aid worker David Haines has been executed by ISIS militants, according to a video posted Saturday to a website associated with the group, making him the third Western captive to be killed by the Islamist extremist group in recent weeks. The ISIS video post showing Haines' beheading called his execution \"a message to the allies of America.\" It is produced very similarly to the videos that showed the executions of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, the last of which included Haines and the threat that he'd be killed next. The new video pictures a masked ISIS militant placing his hand on another captive, whom he identified as Alan Henning, a British citizen. In a tweet, British Prime Minister David Cameron called \"the murder of David Haines\" an \"act of pure evil.\" Cameron added, \"We will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice, however long it takes.\" Haines offers brief scripted comments on the video, as does the man who kills him.\nDirecting his remarks at Britain, the executioner -- who sounds like the man who killed Foley and Sotloff -- says, \"Your evil alliance with America, which continues to strike the Muslims of Iraq and most recently bombed the Haditha dam, will only accelerate your destruction and claim the role of the obedient lap dog. \"Cameron will only drag you and your people into another bloody and unwinnable war.\" Retired Lt. Col. Rick Francona -- an Air Force veteran intelligence officer and CNN military analyst -- surmised that if ISIS planned to dissuade Britain for teaming up with the United States, the group will be disappointed. \"ISIS has just guaranteed British cooperation with the Americans on all phases of what we're going to be doing,\" Francona said. \"... I think this is now a Western fight; it's not just a U.S. fight.\" News of the gruesome killing came the same day that the 44-year-old Haines' family released a brief message to his captors through the British Foreign Office. In it, the family says, \"We have sent messages to you to which we have not received a reply. We are asking those holding David to make contact with us.\" Haines' face became known to the world in the ISIS video, released September 2, in which he looks forward and kneels as a masked ISIS militant stands behind him. The militant says in that video, \"We take this opportunity to warn those governments who've entered this evil alliance of America against the Islamic State to back off and leave our people alone.\" British officials said after the video's release that they had sent troops to try to rescue an unidentified British citizen \"some time ago,\" but failed. They released no other details. Mike Haines, in a statement early Sunday, through the British Foreign Office, noted that his brother leaves behind two children and his wife Dragana. He described his brother as \"just another bloke\" whose \"childhood was centered around our family\" and who was \"brought up to know right from wrong.\" David Haines worked for the Royal Mail, then joined the Royal Air Force. He later worked with the United Nations in the Balkans, where \"he helped whoever needed help, regardless of race, creed or religion,\" according to his brother. \"During this time, David began to decide that humanitarian work was the field he wanted to work in,\" Mike Haines said. \"... David was most alive and enthusiastic in his humanitarian roles.\" After working for ScotRail, David Haines went on to get a job as a logistics and security manager for the Paris-based humanitarian Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development. He was abducted in March 2013 near a refugee camp in Atmeh, Syria, where he was working to arrange for the delivery of humanitarian aid to people staying at the camp. He had previously worked on aid operations for victims of conflict in the Balkans, African and other parts of the Middle East, according to an ACTED spokesman. \"His joy and anticipation for the work he (did) in Syria is, for myself and family, the most important element of this whole sad affair,\" Mike Haines said. \"He was and is loved by all his family and will be missed terribly.\" Another hostage has been publicly killed by ISIS. Another one's life has been threatened. And fighters for ISIS -- which calls itself the Islamic State, in a nod to its efforts to establish a vast caliphate in the Middle East under its strict version of Sharia law -- are continuing to kill innocent civilians in Iraq and Syria. The threat from ISIS has been brewing for some time. Having begun a decade ago as al Qaeda in Iraq -- only to be disowned earlier this year by al Qaeda, the group behind the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, for its heavy-handed tactics -- ISIS has taken advantage of instability in Syria and Iraq to become one of the most prominent and feared groups in the Middle East. ISIS, which is also known as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant or ISIL, managed to become one of the most successful rebel groups working to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. It also rampaged through much of Iraq, thwarting seemingly overmatched Iraqi troops and massacring those who did not subscribe to its extreme version of Islam. It wasn't until last month -- albeit before Foley's killing -- that the American military jumped into the fray. \"It's a bit like trying to predict an earthquake:  You can see pressure building up on the fault lines but not knowing when it's going to materialize (or how) quickly it can disintegrate,\" Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, said Saturday night. \"Those things are very hard to predict.\" Partnering with the Iraqi military and Kurdish fighters, U.S. warplanes have been striking ISIS targets in Iraq regularly since August 8. Earlier this week, President Barack Obama announced that U.S. airstrikes would go after the extremist group in Syria, and perhaps beyond. \"We will hunt down terrorists who threaten our country, wherever they are,\" said Obama, who insisted American troops wouldn't fight \"on foreign soil,\" though they will play support roles. \"That means I will not hesitate to take action against ISIL in Syria, as well as Iraq. This is a core principle of my presidency:  if you threaten America, you will find no safe haven.\" The President vowed the United States won't do it alone. To this end, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry was in Egypt on Saturday seeking that country's help in the fight against ISIS. Britain is one country, at least, that has stepped up -- even before Haines' killing. That includes providing \"urgent military support\" at the Iraqi government's request, including heavy machine guns, body armor and nearly half a million rounds of ammunition to Kurdish fighters known as the Peshmerga. The scale of that support, though, could ramp up now with one Briton executed and Henning's life in limbo. Obama released a statement late Saturday after what he called Haines' \"barbaric murder,\" offering his support for the aid worker's family and his native Britain. \"The United States stands shoulder-to-shoulder tonight with our close friend and ally in grief and resolve,\" the President said. \"We will work with the United Kingdom and a broad coalition of nations from the region and around the world to bring the perpetrators of this outrageous act to justice, and to degrade and destroy this threat to the people of our countries, the region and the world.\"", "label": {"what": ["British aid worker David Haines has been executed by ISIS militants", "He was abducted in March 2013 near a refugee camp in Atmeh, Syria", "And fighters for ISIS -- which calls itself the Islamic State, in a nod to its efforts to establish a vast caliphate in the Middle East under its strict version of Sharia law -- are continuing to kill innocent civilians in Iraq and Syria.", "ISIS has taken advantage of instability in Syria and Iraq to become one of the most prominent and feared groups in the Middle East."], "when": ["on Saturday", "September 2", "early Sunday", "in March 2013", "September 11, 2001", "Saturday night", "since August 8"], "where": ["a website associated with the group", "at Britain", "in the Balkans", "near a refugee camp in Atmeh, Syria", "African and other parts of the Middle East", "in Egypt"], "why": ["The militant says in that video, 'We take this opportunity to warn those governments who've entered this evil alliance of America against the Islamic State to back off and leave our people alone.'"], "who": ["David Haines", "the third Western captive", "American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff", "Alan Henning, a British citizen", "British Prime Minister David Cameron", "Retired Lt.

{"text": "A great white shark that washed ashore on an Australian beach was found to have a large Australian sea lion stuck in its throat. The 13-plus-foot shark choked and died, according to the Western Australia Department of Fisheries. On Saturday, the shark was seen in distress, thrashing in shallow surf at Australia's Coronation Beach. Beachgoers took video of the fish and posted it on YouTube, where the footage has gone viral. Two days later, the shark washed up on the same beach. Shark expert Chris Lowe, of the Cal State Long Beach Shark Lab, said it's unlikely the blockage itself killed the shark. \"They can't choke to death like humans since an esophageal block doesn't restrict breathing in a shark,\" he told the Los Angeles Times by email. \"It's most likely that the shark was rubbing along the seafloor to dislodge the food and the animal just stranded and couldn't get back to deeper water.\" Australian sea lions can grow as large as 8 feet in length and weigh up to 660 pounds. Lowe noted that most sharks have a flexible and elastic esophagus that allows them to swallow very large chunks of food. \"They also possess the ability to evert their stomachs out of their mouths in order to rid the stomach of undigestible items like bones and shells.\" Sometimes that trick, however, doesn't work, as in the case of the shark and the sea lion. And here's another example. In an incident in the fall of 2013, two Canadian men made news when they saved a Greenland shark that was choking on a piece of moose. The shark was lying on the beach with moose hide sticking out of its mouth, CBC News reported. Two local men pulled out the chunk with \"a couple yanks\" then pushed and pulled the shark, with the help of a rope tied to its tail, back out to water. \"All of a sudden, the water started coming out of his gills and he started breathing.\"", "label": {"what": ["A great white shark that washed ashore on an Australian beach was found to have a large Australian sea lion stuck in its throat.", "the shark was seen in distress, thrashing", "the shark washed up on the same beach"], "when": ["On Saturday", "in the fall of 2013"], "where": ["in shallow surf at Australia's Coronation Beach", "on YouTube"], "why": ["it's unlikely the blockage itself killed the shark", "'an esophageal block doesn't restrict breathing in a shark,'", "'It's most likely that the shark was rubbing along the seafloor to dislodge the food and the animal just stranded and couldn't get back to deeper water.'"], "who": ["A great white shark", "the Western Australia Department of Fisheries", "Beachgoers", "Shark expert Chris Lowe, of the Cal State Long Beach Shark Lab", "the Los Angeles Times", "Australian sea lions", "CBC News reported"], "damages": ["The 13-plus-foot shark choked and died", "the footage has gone viral"], "countermeasures": ["Beachgoers took video of the fish and posted it on YouTube"]}}
{"text": "A great white shark that washed up on an Australian beach this week had a sea lion stuck in its throat which likely caused its death, fisheries officials said Thursday. The four-metre (13-foot) white pointer was filmed thrashing around just off Coronation Beach, 430 kilometres (270 miles) north of Perth, and was later found on the sand.

{"text": "Footage has emerged showing the extraordinary moment a dying great white shark tried to beach itself in Australia after biting off more than it could chew. The mysterious death of the four-metre (13-ft) long male sparked an investigation from fisheries officials in Western Australia (WA) when it washed up on Coronation Beach this week. Two days earlier beachgoers had filmed a shark, believed to be the same one, in clear distress as it thrashed about in the shallow water.

{"text": "A shark choked on a sea lion off the coast of Coronation Beach close to Geraldton, Western Australia, according to reports. The 13-foot great white shark was seen thrashing about in the shallow waters while beachgoers watched and filmed the incident, but they didn't realize it was fighting for its life and it eventually died. The shark that choked on a sea lion had been tagged by researchers in southern Australia in January of this year, but swam almost right onto the sand last week. Australia's Department of Fisheries determined that the predator had literally bitten off more than it could chew and gotten some of its prey stuck in its throat. \"This could explain why the shark was exhibiting such unusual behaviour in shallow waters off Coronation Beach. It is possible that the shark was trying to dislodge the blockage,\" Dr. Rory McAuley, the Principal Research Scientist for the agency, said in a press release.

{"text": "Blue Mountains, Australia (CNN) -- More than 70 wildfires -- including 29 that are uncontained -- are raging across a wide swath of Australia's most populous state, now threatening the western suburbs of Sydney, authorities said Wednesday. \"It's only a matter of hours before we see a flare-up in fire activity and a breach of these tenuous containment strategies,\" said Shane Fitzsimmons, Rural Fire Service (RFS) commissioner, in Sydney earlier in the day. The wildfires stretch along a nearly 1,000-mile line in New South Wales, from the far north of the state south of Brisbane -- which lies just across the Queensland border -- to east of Canberra, the country's federal capital. Fires in the Blue Mountain range west of Sydney are a particular worry as rough terrain has impeded firefighting efforts. \"If our strategies don't work and weather materializes tomorrow that is forecast ... it could be absolutely devastating,\" said Rural Fire Service (RFS) Deputy Commissioner Rob Rogers in New South Wales on Tuesday. \"We lost a couple hundred homes the other day -- we could get worse losses than that.\" Wednesday is expected to be \"about as bad as it gets,\" added Fitzsimmons. With high temperatures, low humidity and strong winds forecast, fire officials have urged residents to evacuate from the path of the fires. \"On days like today, minutes really matter,\" Fitzsimmons said. At least one death has been reported. A 63-year-old man died of a suspected heart attack Friday while defending his home against a blaze on the New South Wales Central Coast, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, or ABC, reported. 'Eerie' skies over city of Sydney Some urban areas that border the Australian bush have been devastated by the fires, which have destroyed more than 200 homes in the Blue Mountains region since Thursday. Scores of fires now have burned 25,800 hectares (310,859 acres) -- an area greater than the size of Los Angeles. On Tuesday, officials said they were bringing in 1,500 firefighters to join the more than 1,000 emergency crews already on the ground. At Blue Gum Forest inside the Blue Mountains National Park, firefighters were doing controlled burns -- setting fires in the bush ahead of the frontline of the blazes to eliminate tinder and slow the progress of the fires. Instead of cloud-shrouded mountaintops, the valleys of the region were covered with a dense layer of smoke. Fears are still high that fires could join to form a \"mega-fire\" and endanger heavily populated areas of this popular natural retreat west of Sydney. Most of the firefighters in the area were volunteers who've left their ordinary jobs to put out the fire, pouring in from different parts of Australia. \"There's a sense of community, doing what they can -- you can get a sense of resilience, strength, and a deep sense of pride of each brigade pulling their weight,\" said CNN's Robyn Curnow, reporting from the Blue Mountains. The state of emergency issued by authorities gives firefighters and police the authority to carry out measures such as cutting off water, power and gas and ordering mandatory evacuations of areas at risk. A total fire ban is in place for the Greater Sydney region until further notice, officials have said, meaning no fire may be lit in the open, and all fire permits are suspended. The fires have spread a cloak of smog over Sydney in recent days. The bush fires in the area spread out of control Thursday amid high temperatures and powerful winds. Emergency officials said the region is emerging from a very dry winter and has had little rain in recent months. The causes of the Blue Mountains fires are still under investigation -- officials are looking into whether one major blaze was caused by a military training exercise. Police said Monday they had arrested two boys, age 11 and 15, over two earlier bush fires in the Port Stephens area, more than 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Sydney, that began October 13. One of the fires they are accused of starting burned more than 5,000 hectares (12,000 acres) in the surrounding area. The 11-year-old has been placed under house arrest, charged with two counts of intentionally causing fire and being reckless as to its spread, NSW Police Force said.

{"text": "(CNN) -- Australia's bushfires have such a long and destructive history there's almost no day of the week that hasn't been dubbed \"black\" or \"ash\" to mark a major conflagration. There was Black Thursday in Victoria in 1851, which destroyed five million hectares and claimed 12 lives -- the first large-scale bushfire in the history of white settlement in Australia. Since then there's been Red Tuesday in 1898 in Victoria, which consumed 2,000 buildings, Black Friday in Victoria in 1938 that killed 71 and destroyed 3,700 buildings, and Ash Wednesday in the early 1980s that left 71 dead in the state of South Australia. Most recently in 2009, Black Saturday claimed 173 lives in the state of Victoria in southern Australia -- many of the victims unable to even get the distance of their own driveways before they succumbed to the intense radiant heat generated by a bushfire. Many argue that Australia's catastrophic bushfires are simply a fact of life on a continent where its flora, heavy with combustible eucalyptus oil, constitute something of a seasonal time bomb. Others say more sinister man-made factors are at work. Changing climate Australia has had a troubled relationship with climate change -- its confused policies on a controversial carbon tax are credited with felling the Labor Party at the last election, while the new government controversially disbanded the country's Climate Commission -- but scientists say the latest bushfire season may turn up the heat on the climate-change skeptics. While the jury is still out on whether climate change is making conditions perfect for large-scale bushfires, scientists agree that bushfire seasons -- a regular occurrence on the Australian seasonal calendar -- are getting longer and the fires more intense. According to David Bowman, professor of forest ecology at the University of Tasmania, who has studied bushfires for more than 30 years, bushfire behavior is showing signs of change. \"The problem with Australia is that the records are pretty shallow, which makes it really difficult to talk conclusively about any of the fire activity. But when you piece everything together there's some very convincing evidence. Aggressive fires \"Even the firefighters are reporting really unusual behavior,\" said Bowman, adding that firefighters are fighting bigger and more aggressive fires. \"Normally at night -- and this is borne out by firefighters in the United States -- the fire will quell as the temperature cools. But firefighters are saying that because of the heat, bushfires are burning just as fiercely at night. It's all getting pretty worrying.\" He said duration was also a factor that was changing in bushfire behavior. \"It's no big deal to have a fire in October but to have one that has burned like this for more than a week at this level of intensity is unprecedented.\n\"We are now looking at really catastrophic fire weather -- for October it just doesn't compute.\" Anatomy of a bush fire:  How Australia's explosive forest fires work v\nA nation built on fire Fire has been part of the Australian landscape since the dawn of time and its people have used fire as a farming tool for more than 40,000 years. One of the earliest colonial watercolors shows an Aboriginal man gently setting fire to land that now makes up Sydney's most expensive waterside suburb of Vaucluse. Known as fire-stick farming, this mosaic of fire management systems not only flushed out game such as kangaroos and possums, it created new growth which in turn attracted more game. With indigenous people no longer part of the forest management equation, some scientists argue the fuel load that builds up from Australia's notoriously combustible vegetation is now one aspect that needs to be addressed. Pyrogeography Meanwhile, the emerging academic discipline of pyrogeography is looking at bushfires in Australia -- not just as a one-off catastrophic event -- but as part of an interconnected whole where forest fires around the world feed climate change and make conditions ripe for the propagation of even more fires. Bowman says that deforestation fires alone -- the fires that have been used to destroy forests since the industrial revolution -- account for about one-fifth of all carbon dioxide committed to the atmosphere. \"That's a very significant component in global warming,\" he said. One thing that is being noticed by scientists is that black carbon from forest fires is landing on ice sheets and accelerating ice melt. Slippery factors \"These are tricky and slippery factors because there are places where feedback from fires is actually causing cooling, especially in places where the loss of forest has caused the snow to lie for longer leading to regional cooling.\" Vegetation and natural conditions may change dramatically between New South Wales, Sumatra and California, but one thing these fires all share in common is that they are becoming more regular because the climate is becoming warmer. Bowman said that vegetation in parts of Victoria, which normally completely regenerates over a 50-year cycle, is now being burned as often as three times in the period of one decade. The particles from forest fires, he said, actually inhibit rainfall contributing to regional drying and warming, which creates a weather cycle conducive to fires. The problem for scientists, he added, was in connecting the dots with these patterns. \"It's like trying to find needles in haystacks.\"", "label": {"what": ["there's almost no day of the week that hasn't been dubbed ''black'' or ''ash'' to mark a major conflagration", "bushfire seasons -- a regular occurrence on the Australian seasonal calendar -- are getting longer and the fires more intense", "really difficult to talk conclusively about any of the fire activity", "firefighters are fighting bigger and more aggressive fires", "Vegetation and natural conditions may change dramatically between New South Wales, Sumatra and California, but one thing these fires all share in common is that they are becoming more regular"], "when": ["in 1851", "in 1898", "in 1938", "in the early 1980s", "Most recently in 2009", "in October"], "where": ["in Victoria", "in Australia", "in the state of South Australia", "in the state of Victoria in southern Australia", "in the United States", "Sydney's most expensive waterside suburb of Vaucluse", "between New South Wales, Sumatra and California", "in parts of Victoria"], "why": ["Australia's bushfires have such a long and destructive history", "Australia's catastrophic bushfires are simply a fact of life on a continent where its flora, heavy with combustible eucalyptus oil, constitute something of a seasonal time bomb", "more sinister man-made factors are at work", "The problem with Australia is that the records are pretty shallow", "because of the heat", "duration was also a factor that was changing in bushfire behavior", "since the dawn of time and its people have used fire as a farming tool for more than 40,000 years", "the climate is becoming warmer", "The particles from forest fires, he said, actually inhibit rainfall contributing to regional drying and warming, which creates a weather cycle conducive to fires", "deforestation fires alone -- the fires that have been used to destroy forests since the industrial revolution -- account for about one-fifth of all carbon dioxide committed to the atmosphere", "black carbon from forest fires is landing on ice sheets and accelerating ice melt"], "who": ["Black Thursday", "Red Tuesday", "Black Friday", "Ash Wednesday", "Black Saturday claimed", "Australia", "the Labor Party", "the new government", "the country's Climate Commission", "the jury", "scientists", "David Bowman, professor of forest ecology at the University of Tasmania", "the firefighters", "an Aboriginal man"], "damages": ["many of the victims unable to even get the distance of their own driveways", "may turn up the heat on the climate-change skeptics", "bushfires are burning just as fiercely at night"], "countermeasures": ["the emerging academic discipline of pyrogeography is looking at bushfires in Australia -- not just as a one-off catastrophic event -- but as part of an interconnected whole where forest fires around the world feed climate change and make conditions ripe for the propagation of even more fires", "connecting the dots with these patterns"]}}
{"text": "SYDNEY V  Winds that were fanning wildfires and showering embers on threatened communities eased late Wednesday, after scores of Australians evacuated their homes in mountains west of Sydney. All schools had closed in the Blue Mountains in anticipation of bad fire conditions, and authorities advised residents who were not prepared to defend their homes to leave for evacuation centers. One center in west suburban Sydney was housing 120 evacuees. Springwood resident Rae Tebbutt said the atmosphere was tense in the village that was one of the worst-hit last week, when the region lost more than 200 homes to blazes that also caused one death. \"Everyone is terrified,\" she said. \"I've got three friends who have lost everything.\" Seventy-one blazes were burning in New South Wales state around Sydney, including 29 burning out of control, Rural Fire Service commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said. As the temperatures and winds dropped, the danger of fire spreading eased with no reports of injuries or property loss. While many hours of firefighting are still to come, \"the broader risk to a much larger, more widespread population has certainly eased,\" Fitzsimmons told reporters. Temperatures in the fire zones rose above 90 degrees Fahrenheit. And winds blew up to 50 miles per hour, forcing water-bombing helicopters to suspend operations during the day, Fire Service spokesman Ben Shepherd said.

{"text": "(Reuters) - Australian firefighters battled massive wildfires in bushland around Sydney on Wednesday, but hot weather that could have caused a catastrophic mega-fire did not materialize, allowing authorities to tell some evacuated residents it was safe to return to home. However, the crisis was far from over with new fires igniting and strong winds fanning blazes in the Blue Mountains, a major commuter area of small towns west of Sydney. Around 60 fires were still burning across New South Wales (NSW) state, with more than 2,000 firefighters struggling to contain them, with more hot and windy weather forecast. As exhausted firefighters moved from fire to fire, residents used garden hoses to try and save their homes. More than 200 homes have been destroyed in NSW since last Thursday, when fires tore through Sydney's outskirts, razing entire streets. One man died from a heart attack while trying to save his home. Earlier on Wednesday, residents in the Blue Mountains were urged to drive down to the safety of metropolitan Sydney, but by the evening some were returning home. \"If you have been someone that has chosen to depart the Blue Mountains today...(to) be out of harm's way, then it would be safe to head back home tonight because the risk has been averted,\" said Rural Fire Service (RFS) Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons. Fitzsimmons warned the situation could deteriorate again and urged people to be vigilant. \"There are still fires flaring up, impacting on communities this afternoon,\" he said. \"I won't rest easy until I know things have settled right down over the next 24 hours or so and we start seeing some really good further consolidation of control lines and bringing these fires more under control.\" The fires have burned through more than 120,000 hectares (300,000 acres) and have a perimeter of some 1,600 km (990 miles). Firefighters fear strong winds may see three major fires in the Blue Mountains join up in coming days, creating one massive wildfire. Air pollution in parts of Sydney has spiked with some neighborhoods blanketed in smoke. The NSW government has declared a state of emergency enabling it to order evacuations, hoping to avoid a repeat of the 2009 \"Black Saturday\" fires in Victoria state that killed 173 people and caused $4.4 billion worth of damage. The insurance council of Australia said claims of more than A$93 million ($90 million) were expected to grow. Police have arrested several children suspected of starting a number of different fires. Other fires were sparked by power lines arcing in strong winds, according to the fire service. The biggest fire was started during an army training exercise when an explosion ignited bushland. CLIMATE CHANGE Record hot and dry weather across Australia and an early start to the fire season in the Southern Hemisphere spring have revived arguments about mankind's impact on climate change. Climate scientists say Australia is one of the countries most at risk from global warming, with fires, floods and droughts a feature of the continent. But conservative Prime Minister Tony Abbott has rejected any link between the Sydney fires and rising carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, a major Australian export. \"Climate change is real and we should take strong action against it,\" Abbott told local radio. \"But these fires are certainly not a function of climate change, they are just a function of life in Australia.\" Elected in September, Abbott plans to repeal a carbon emissions tax installed by the previous government and replace it with a \"Direct Action\" scheme involving things like reforestation and financial incentives to business to cut pollution.", "label": {"what": ["massive wildfires in bushland", "Around 60 fires were still burning", "the situation could deteriorate again", "'There are still fires flaring up, impacting on communities this afternoon'", "The fires have burned through more than 120,000 hectares (300,000 acres) and have a perimeter of some 1,600 km"], "when": ["since last Thursday", "Earlier on Wednesday", "in September"], "where": ["Sydney", "in bushland around Sydney", "in the Blue Mountains", "a major commuter area of small towns west of Sydney", "across New South Wales (NSW) state", "in NSW", "the safety of metropolitan Sydney", "in Victoria state", "across Australia"], "why": ["several children suspected of starting a number of different fires", "Other fires were sparked by power lines arcing in strong winds", "an explosion ignited bushland", "Australia is one of the countries most at risk from global warming, with fires, floods and droughts a feature of the continent", "they are just a function of life in Australia"], "who": ["Australian firefighters", "authorities", "some evacuated residents", "said Rural Fire Service (RFS) Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons", "The NSW government has declared", "The insurance council of Australia said", "the fire service", "Climate scientists", "conservative Prime Minister Tony Abbott", "local radio"], "damages": ["more hot and windy weather forecast", "More than 200 homes have been destroyed", "fires tore through Sydney's outskirts, razing entire streets", "One man died from a heart attack", "Air pollution in parts of Sydney has spiked with some neighbourhoods blanketed in smoke.", "claims of more than A$93 million were expected to grow", "have revived arguments about mankind's impact on climate change"], "countermeasures": ["more than 2,000 firefighters struggling to contain them", "exhausted firefighters moved from fire to fire, residents used garden hoses to try and save their homes", "urged people to be vigilant", "we start seeing some really good further consolidation of control lines and bringing these fires more under control", "The NSW government has declared a state of emergency enabling it to order evacuations", "repeal a carbon emissions tax installed by the previous government and replace it with a 'Direct Action' scheme", "reforestation and financial incentives to business to cut pollution"]}}
{"text": "(Reuters) - A plane dousing wildfires in bushland south of Australia's biggest city, Sydney, crashed into a national park on Thursday, killing the pilot and sparking a new fire to add to 55 still burning across the state of New South Wales. The accident happened as more dry, windy conditions caused a flare-up in huge fires burning for a week in mountains to the west of Sydney, closing roads and entering a valley running down towards the metropolitan area. \"It's hard to definitely say that (the worst is over) at this stage,\" said Rural Fire Service spokeswoman Natalie Sanders. \"We have got cooler temperatures today and the winds are slightly lower but with these fires still going, it's hard to say how long they'll go for and whether there will be any further damage.\" Emergency officials confirmed a 43-year-old man died when his water bomber fixed-wing aircraft crashed in the Budawang National Park, 270 km (170 miles) southwest of Sydney, a wilderness area popular with hikers and campers. Rescue workers were unable to retrieve the body, driven back by high winds, smoke and the rugged terrain. \"It's a tragedy for the fire-fighting community,\" said RFS Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons. More than 200 homes have been destroyed in New South Wales since last Thursday, when fires tore through Sydney's outskirts. A man died from a heart attack as he tried to save his home. The fires have burned through tens of thousands of acres (hectares) and at one stage had a combined perimeter of about 1,600 km (1,000 miles).

{"text": "Sydney:   Fire officials defended Australia's defense department today after investigators revealed a military training exercise ignited the largest of the wildfires that have torn across the nation's most populous state over the past week. The Rural Fire Service said yesterday that one of the more than 100 fires that have burned since last week began at a Defense Department training area as a result of \"live ordnance exercises.\" The fire it sparked near the city of Lithgow, west of Sydney, has burned 47,000 hectares and destroyed several houses, but no injuries or deaths were reported from the blaze. In a statement, Acting Defense Minister George Brandis said the military was cooperating with investigators. Rural Fire Service commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said the defense department's actions were obviously an accident. \"It wasn't deliberate; it was a side effect of a routine activity, it would appear, and clearly there was no intention to see fire start up and run as a result of that activity,\" Fitzsimmons said. \"There is no conspiracy here.\" Meanwhile, police said a pilot helping fight a fire near Ulladulla, south of Sydney, was killed when his fixed-wing aircraft crashed in a remote area yesterday morning. The 43-year-old man was the only person on board. \"We are trying to recover the pilot from the scene but are being challenged by weather conditions and nearby fire,\" New South Wales police Superintendent Joe Cassar told reporters in Nowra, a city near Ulladulla. The fires over the past week have killed one resident and destroyed more than 200 homes in New South Wales state. Sixty-five fires were burning, with 24 out of control, though all emergency warnings had been lifted. Investigators are still looking into the causes of the other fires. Some were started by power lines brought down in strong winds, the fire service said. A few appear to have been deliberately lit, and police have arrested several children in connection with those.

{"text": "A massive fire burning in Australia's Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, was caused by explosives training being carried out by the Department of Defence, a probe has found. The Rural Fire Service (RFS) said the training exercise was responsible for causing the blaze, which has burnt out more than 46,000 hectares and sparked fears of it becoming a \"mega-fire\". \"The investigation has concluded the fire started as a result of exploding ordnances on the range on Wednesday,\" said an RFS spokesman. Blue Mountains mayor Mark Greenhill told ABC News that even though there was no fire ban on the day the fire started, the exercise should not have gone ahead. \"I would have hoped on a day like that which was a dry day, a hot day, with the winds, the Australian military would have known it wasn't a good time to be igniting,\" he said. \"The fire has caused great concern to my community and it just shouldn't have happened.\" A Department of Defence statement said:  \"Defence is aware the NSW Rural Fire Service is of the view that the cause of the State Mine Fire near Lithgow was as a result of a Defence live ordnance exercise at Marangaroo Training Area.\" The statement said it \"continues to co-operate fully\" with the investigation and is also conducting its own inquiry. The news comes after another day of drama for the bushfire crisis in the state of New South Wales. Strong winds and hotter temperatures forced authorities to declare the situation was \"as bad as it gets\" prompting all schools in the Blue Mountains region to close and many businesses to shut. Thousands of locals also fled the area. Last week the town of Springwood and the surrounding area lost more than 200 homes. At one stage Springwood came under renewed attack as strong winds pushed burning embers towards houses. Thick smoke hung over residential streets as water-bombing aircraft and fire trucks targeted new areas of burning bush. Resident Craig Robinson told Sky News he was staying to protect his home, which backs onto the bush. \"I won't go until they tell me I can't stay,\" he said. \"We feel well prepared. We have cleared around the house and we have moved out valuables, cars and animals so we will wait and see what happens.\" Back burning efforts in recent days along with non-stop water bombing meant no properties were lost despite the threat and residents were told it was safe for them to return to their homes. NSW Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitszimmons declared firefighters had triumphed in extreme conditions. \"It would be safe to head back home tonight because the risk has been averted,\" he said. However, he warned there was still a lot of difficult and dangerous firefighting being carried out. State premier Barry O'Farrell lauded the \"magnificent planning and preparation\" which helped avert disaster. Authorities expect a southerly change to come but it will be dry and bring \"fairly strong\" southwest winds on Thursday, meaning the danger is still not over. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Tony Abbott has been forced to deny climate change was to blame for the fires. Speaking on 3AW radio he said:  \"Look, climate change is real, as I often said, and we should take strong action against it, but these fires are certainly not a function of climate change, they are just a function of life in Australia.\"", "label": {"what": ["A massive fire burning in Australia's Blue Mountains", "Springwood came under renewed attack", "there was still a lot of difficult and dangerous firefighting being carried out", "the danger is still not over"], "when": ["on Wednesday", "on Thursday"], "where": ["in Australia's Blue Mountains, west of Sydney", "near Lithgow", "in the state of New South Wales", "the town of Springwood and the surrounding area"], "why": ["was caused by explosives training", "the training exercise was responsible for causing the blaze", "the fire started as a result of exploding ordnances on the range", "Strong winds and hotter temperatures", "as strong winds pushed burning embers towards houses", "'they are just a function of life in Australia.'"], "who": ["the Department of Defence", "The Rural Fire Service (RFS) said", "an RFS spokesman", "Blue Mountains mayor Mark Greenhill", "ABC News", "the Australian military", "'the cause of the State Mine Fire near Lithgow was as a result of a Defence live ordnance exercise at Marangaroo Training Area.'", "authorities", "Thousands of locals", "Resident Craig Robinson", "Sky News", "NSW Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitszimmons", "State premier Barry O'Farrell", "Prime Minister Tony Abbott"], "damages": ["has burnt out more than 46,000 hectares and sparked fears of it becoming a 'mega-fire'", "'The fire has caused great concern to my community'", "all schools in the Blue Mountains region to close and many businesses to shut", "the town of Springwood and the surrounding area lost more than 200 homes"], "countermeasures": ["it 'continues to co-operate fully' with the investigation and is also conducting its own inquiry", "water-bombing aircraft and fire trucks targeted new areas of burning bush", "'We have cleared around the house and we have moved out valuables, cars and animals so we will wait and see what happens.'", "the 'magnificent planning and preparation' which helped avert disaster"]}}
{"text": "Improving weather has given firefighters the upper hand over bushfires still burning in the Blue Mountains, Southern Highlands and Hunter regions of New South Wales, after week in which two people died and more than 200 homes were destroyed. The central west town of Trangie is mourning the loss of a 43-year-old man, who died in a plane crash while fighting fires on Thursday morning. The pilot was flying a fixed-wing aircraft, waterbombing a fire west of Ulladulla on the state s south coast when it went down in rugged and mountainous bushland. His wife requested that his identity not be published while she informs family members, including her children. The crash also sparked another fire in the area, to which other aerial firefighters immediately responded. Fires and strong winds prevented rescue crews from retrieving the pilot until Friday morning. \"It is far too dangerous to send any personnel down there,\" Shoalhaven local area commander Superintendent Joe Cassara said on Thursday afternoon. Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons of the Rural Fire Service said the death was tragedy for the firefighting community as well as the man s family. We're all acutely aware that there is a family suffering today because their dad hasn't come home,\" Fitzsimmons said on Thursday. \"Without a doubt our thoughts and prayers are with the loved ones who are spending time with RFS officers on the south coast and trying to come to grips with this.\" On Friday it was revealed the type of plane that the pilot had been flying was the subject of safety investigations as long as seven months ago. Fairfax reported this was the fourth fatality in an M18 Dromader aircraft, the second crash while fighting fires. Last Friday, 63-year-old Walter Linder suffered a heart attack while defending his home from bushfires at Lake Munmorah on the central coast. There are still dozens of fires burning around the state, including three on the second highest alert level of  watch and act . The largest of these bushfires is the State Mine fire near Lithgow, inadvertently sparked by the army at the Marrangaroo base. While the Defence Department is still conducting its investigation, the RFS has concluded that explosive ordnance training exercises caused the fire, which has burned through nearly 50,000 hectares. The efforts of defence personnel to put out the fire were hampered by the ordnance stored on the site, which also prevented the RFS from sending in firefighters, trucks or aircraft, despite the fact they were on scene within 30 minutes. \"I do apologise, because it has been identified that this fire was the start of this mine fire,\" the acting chief of defence, Air Marshal Mark Binskin, told reporters at RFS headquarters in Sydney on Thursday. Binskin said Marrangaroo personnel were a part of the Blue Mountains community and that many were RFS volunteers. He said defence personnel were among those who had lost their homes. The NSW Premier, Barry O Farrell, said he would speak to the prime minister, Tony Abbott, about the incident and possible compensation. Defence live ordnance activity is also thought to be behind three other fires in recent months, according to the ABC. Last week, the State Mine fire was joined with another burning at Mt Victoria, as part of high-risk backburning strategies deployed by the RFS. There were fears the two fires would join with the destructive Linksview Road, Springwood fire, which destroyed nearly 200 homes, many of them in the town of Winmalee. It was determined the Springwood and Mt Victoria fires were started by power lines in strong winds. The emergency recovery co-ordinator for the Blue Mountains, Phil Koperberg, said on Friday about 67 damaged or destroyed homes contained asbestos. The former fire services commissioner said the risk was  minimal, but nevertheless we are taking the precaution of putting signs on all those properties where asbestos has been found , warning people not to enter before the rubble was treated and removed. Once you start digging around this stuff, you loosen it, it becomes airborne  and ingestible, he said. Wednesday s weather did indeed bring hotter, drier and windier conditions as expected, and while several fires flared up as a result, there was no further loss of life or property   a result that Fitzsimmons said was due to  aggressive and high-risk strategies  by a record number of firefighters. Almost 1000 firefighters from interstate joined the NSW effort, drafted from around the country, including metropolitan crews to support Sydney stations whose crew were deployed to the bush. At its peak on Thursday October 17, the crisis included eight fires on simultaneous  emergency warning  alerts, stretching from the southern highlands, out west to the Blue Mountains and Hawkesbury, and north to the Hunter valley and mid north coast. Two boys aged 11 and 15 are facing court over a fire which began near Heatherbrae, burned through around 5,000 hectares and destroyed several buildings. It was while fighting this fire that Walter Linder died. Several other children were apprehended by police for attempting to or starting fires in the last week. The youngest were two eight-year-olds discovered discovered by police in East Maitland after a tip-off from the public, trying to light leaves and kindling with a lighter, which turned out to be broken. Fitzsimmons said the news was  disappointing . \"Lighting fires is a crime, no matter your background, no matter your age, not matter your location,  he said. \"I think you would have to be on another planet if you didn't understand the education associated with lighting fires. Sadly when we're all young we don't appreciate the consequences of actions.\" In the last of his formal briefings on Thursday, Fitzsimmons described the firefighting efforts of the last week as  extraordinary . He thanked the community for their accolades and praise of the RFS firefighters and emergency service workers and volunteers who  have all been working shoulder to shoulder as an army of men and women seeking to protect and serve communities .

{"text": "Sydney:   Australian firefighters battled massive wildfires in bushland around Sydney today, but hot weather that could have caused a catastrophic mega-fire did not materialise, allowing authorities to tell some evacuated residents it was safe to return to home. However, the crisis was far from over with new fires igniting and strong winds fanning blazes in the Blue Mountains, a major commuter area of small towns west of Sydney. Around 60 fires were still burning across New South Wales (NSW) state, with more than 2,000 firefighters struggling to contain them, with more hot and windy weather forecast. As exhausted firefighters moved from fire to fire, residents used garden hoses to try and save their homes. More than 200 homes have been destroyed in NSW since last Thursday, when fires tore through Sydney's outskirts, razing entire streets. One man died from a heart attack while trying to save his home. Earlier on Wednesday, residents in the Blue Mountains were urged to drive down to the safety of metropolitan Sydney, but by the evening some were returning home. \"If you have been someone that has chosen to depart the Blue Mountains today...(to) be out of harm's way, then it would be safe to head back home tonight because the risk has been averted,\" said Rural Fire Service (RFS) Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons. Fitzsimmons warned the situation could deteriorate again and urged people to be vigilant. \"There are still fires flaring up, impacting on communities this afternoon,\" he said. \"I won't rest easy until I know things have settled right down over the next 24 hours or so and we start seeing some really good further consolidation of control lines and bringing these fires more under control.\" The fires have burned through more than 120,000 hectares (300,000 acres) and have a perimeter of some 1,600 km. Firefighters fear strong winds may see three major fires in the Blue Mountains join up in coming days, creating one massive wildfire. Air pollution in parts of Sydney has spiked with some neighbourhoods blanketed in smoke. The NSW government has declared a state of emergency enabling it to order evacuations, hoping to avoid a repeat of the 2009 \"Black Saturday\" fires in Victoria state that killed 173 people and caused $4.4 billion worth of damage. The insurance council of Australia said claims of more than A$93 million were expected to grow. Police have arrested several children suspected of starting a number of different fires. Other fires were sparked by power lines arcing in strong winds, according to the fire service. The biggest fire was started during an army training exercise when an explosion ignited bushland. Climate change Record hot and dry weather across Australia and an early start to the fire season in the Southern Hemisphere spring have revived arguments about mankind's impact on climate change. Climate scientists say Australia is one of the countries most at risk from global warming, with fires, floods and droughts a feature of the continent. But conservative Prime Minister Tony Abbott has rejected any link between the Sydney fires and rising carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, a major Australian export. \"Climate change is real and we should take strong action against it,\" Abbott told local radio. \"But these fires are certainly not a function of climate change, they are just a function of life in Australia.\" Elected in September, Abbott plans to repeal a carbon emissions tax installed by the previous government and replace it with a \"Direct Action\" scheme involving things like reforestation and financial incentives to business to cut pollution.", "label": {"what": ["massive wildfires in bushland", "Around 60 fires were still burning", "the situation could deteriorate again", "'There are still fires flaring up, impacting on communities this afternoon'", "The fires have burned through more than 120,000 hectares (300,000 acres) and have a perimeter of some 1,600 km"], "when": ["since last Thursday", "Earlier on Wednesday", "in September"], "where": ["Sydney", "in bushland around Sydney", "in the Blue Mountains", "a major commuter area of small towns west of Sydney", "across New South Wales (NSW) state", "in NSW", "the safety of metropolitan Sydney", "in Victoria state", "across Australia"], "why": ["several children suspected of starting a number of different fires", "Other fires were sparked by power lines arcing in strong winds", "an explosion ignited bushland", "Australia is one of the countries most at risk from global warming, with fires, floods and droughts a feature of the continent", "they are just a function of life in Australia"], "who": ["Australian firefighters", "authorities", "some evacuated residents", "said Rural Fire Service (RFS) Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons", "The NSW government has declared", "The insurance council of Australia said", "the fire service", "Climate scientists", "conservative Prime Minister Tony Abbott", "local radio"], "damages": ["more hot and windy weather forecast", "More than 200 homes have been destroyed", "fires tore through Sydney's outskirts, razing entire streets", "One man died from a heart attack", "Air pollution in parts of Sydney has spiked with some neighbourhoods blanketed in smoke.", "claims of more than A$93 million were expected to grow", "have revived arguments about mankind's impact on climate change"], "countermeasures": ["more than 2,000 firefighters struggling to contain them", "exhausted firefighters moved from fire to fire, residents used garden hoses to try and save their homes", "urged people to be vigilant", "we start seeing some really good further consolidation of control lines and bringing these fires more under control", "The NSW government has declared a state of emergency enabling it to order evacuations", "repeal a carbon emissions tax installed by the previous government and replace it with a 'Direct Action' scheme", "reforestation and financial incentives to business to cut pollution"]}}
{"text": "MELBOURNE, AustraliaXWildfires consuming parts of eastern Australia are unlikely to dent the economy in the way other natural disasters have in recent years, despite being the worst to strike the country's most-populous state since the 1960s. The biggest fires are centered in the Blue Mountains region west of Sydney, an area that is popular with tourists but is away from farmland and key resource-producing regions. Unlike severe floods in northeastern Queensland state nearly three years ago that wiped out fruit and vegetable crops and disrupted coal shipments for months, the latest wildfires will have an \"almost negligible\" impact on economic activity, Australia  and  New Zealand Banking Group ANZ.AU +1.08%  senior economist Felicity Emmett said in a research report Friday. \"The bush fires have caused little or no damage to the local infrastructure,\" she said. On Friday, dozens of fires continued to burn across eastern New South Wales, although the state's Rural Fire Service said only a handful were still out of control as cooler temperatures in recent days helped firefighters tackle the blazes. More than 200 homes have been destroyed and another 100 damaged in the Blue Mountains since the fires were sparked last Thursday by unusually high spring temperatures and strong winds across the state. The country has been hit by a succession of extreme weather events in recent years. In 2009, 173 people were killed by wildfires that swept across Victoria state, and in late 2010 and early 2011 Queensland state was hit hard by flooding and cyclones. Insurance losses for the latest fires have reached around 138 million Australian dollars (US$132.5 million), the Insurance Council of Australia, an organization representing insurers, estimated Friday. Insurance Australia Group IAG.AU +0.36%  said it had so far received about 600 claims, but with assessors unable to visit all affected areas and fires still burning it was too soon to give an indication of cost. The company's exposure is capped at A$150 million this year, after which its reinsurance kicks in. The damage bill from cyclones, flooding and fires swelled to more than A$5 billion in 2011--one of the worst years on record for natural disasters in Australia. The Queensland floods alone saw more than 25 million tons of coal production lost and shaved around three-quarters of a percentage point from economic growth in fiscal 2011, according to ANZ. By comparison, insurance losses so far this year from wildfires and tropical storms stand at around A$1.4 billion, the Insurance Council said. Rail and port operator Asciano Ltd. AIO.AU +0.58%  said Friday the New South Wales fires had damaged its rail network, disrupting coal-haulage. A line transporting coal from the Blue Mountains was closed Oct. 18, but should be running again next week, a spokesman said. Asciano hauls coal across New South Wales state, including from several big mines in the Hunter Valley, to export facilities like the Port of Newcastle, the world's largest coal export terminals. Among its major clients are Glencore Xstrata International PLC and Rio Tinto RIO.LN +0.14%  PLC's Coal  and  Allied unit.", "label": {"what": ["AustraliaXWildfires consuming parts of eastern Australia", "strike the country's most-populous state", "The biggest fires are centered in the Blue Mountains region west of Sydney", "dozens of fires continued to burn across eastern New South Wales", "only a handful were still out of control"], "when": ["since the 1960s", "On Friday", "last Thursday", "In 2009", "in late 2010 and early 2011", "in 2011", "Oct. 18"], "where": ["MELBOURNE, Australia", "the Blue Mountains region west of Sydney", "northeastern Queensland state", "across Victoria state", "in Australia", "the New South Wales", "in the Hunter Valley", "the Port of Newcastle"], "why": ["an area that is popular with tourists but is away from farmland and key resource-producing regions", "the fires were sparked last Thursday by unusually high spring temperatures and strong winds across the state"], "who": ["Australia and New Zealand Banking Group ANZ.AU +1.08% senior economist Felicity Emmett said", "the state's Rural Fire Service said", "Queensland state", "the Insurance Council of Australia", "Insurance Australia Group IAG.AU +0.36% said", "Rail and port operator Asciano Ltd.
